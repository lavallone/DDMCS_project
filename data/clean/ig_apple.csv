Leading this evolution are devices like the Quest 3 and Apple’s Vision Pro, providing novel ways to engage with entertainment, especially in the realm of sports.

While the idea of an XR-integrated F1 companion app remains theoretical for now, it illustrates how this technology could enhance the conventional viewing experience. Conceived by John LePore, the concept suggests the potential to project 3D maps and live race data into viewers’ surroundings, presenting a unique and interactive approach to race following.

wired,2024-01-29,1362,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2sViTUBStu/,"Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is coming to the real world on February 2, and all the previews so far have shown it to be a great bundle of contradictions. It’s capable but clunky. Mobile but tethered to a battery pack. Exciting but just so, so expensive—$3,499 for the base model.

Perhaps most importantly, the demonstrations the company has given of the Vision Pro (so far) reveal that it will feature a small number of compatible apps at launch. That’s a big deal for an Apple product, whose predecessors owe a lot of their success to the app ecosystems that have blossomed around them.

Even though the Vision Pro is highly anticipated, it's entering a sagging market for VR headsets and arriving at a time of bad blood between Apple and its developers. All this creates an unwelcoming environment for Vision Pro apps.

Tap the 🔗 in our bio to learn more about why app developers say the high price and secretive rollout of Apple’s mixed-reality headset have led to them taking a “wait-and-see” approach to building software for it."
puckdotnews,2024-01-29,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2qz48mtGo0/,"We’ve seen so many V.R. headsets fail—Google Glass, Snap’s Spectacles, the Meta Quest—that we’ve come to doubt the category. But things may be different when the technology is applied to entertainment and gaming—and when the company that created the modern gadget platform (and then continued to iterate on it) is involved.

At the link in bio, Julia Alexander identifies the crucial steps Apple needs to take to ensure that the Vision Pro becomes an actual platform—not just expensive coffee table art.

If you know one thing about the headset, it’s probably the fact that it’s $3,500. Sure, the company has been known for its premium pricing for several decades now, but $3,500 isn’t a consumer price. The Vision Pro isn’t a consumer product.

While the headset is neater and works better than expected, it’s still unclear who — or what — it’s for. People will read that and get more interested, but very few will be $3,500 interested. It’s a big leap of faith to take for what purports to be a new computing paradigm.

cnbc,2024-01-30,2918,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2usyOgulOu/,"From Deputy Technology Editor Todd Haselton:
-

Apple’s long-awaited headset, which starts at $3,500, launches in the U.S. on Friday. It’s the company’s first major new gadget to hit the market since the Apple Watch debuted in April 2015. I’ve been testing it for nearly a week. While it has some shortcomings, it’s easily the most fun new product I’ve tried out in years.

Analysts don’t expect the Vision Pro to drive massive amounts of revenue initially. UBS anticipates Apple will ship about 400,000 headsets, leading to a “relatively immaterial” $1.4 billion in revenue this year. However, I’m convinced that if Apple eventually sells cheaper versions, we’ll see millions of people using them in the coming years.

The Vision Pro offers a new kind of experience that Apple calls “spatial computing.” You sit in your world while looking at a digital one, and then plop different apps around you. You can work, play games, watch movies or surf the web.

Thanks to very sharp displays, and a full M2 processor that’s usually found in Macs, the Vision Pro has the power to do a lot of what you’d expect from an Apple device. There’s a dedicated App Store for Vision Pro apps, but you can also install more than a million iPhone or iPad apps. Or pair it with your Mac and work while looking at a 4K display inside the goggles.

I’m only scratching the surface of the capabilities, but here’s the gist: This is an entirely new type of computing, providing a whole new world of experiences. It feels like the future.

Parts of it are stunning. Others don't feel entirely finished. ⁠
⁠
Apple's Vision Pro is the most advanced blend of mixed reality in a standalone device Scott has ever experienced. There are parts of the Vision Pro that feel like any other Apple device and parts that decidedly don't. ⁠

The preattached Solo Knit headband feels like a padded ski goggle head strap. It's comfy at first, but after half an hour, the headset feels top-heavy and pushed in on Scott's cheeks a bit.⁠

The conversation turns to developer challenges and the possibilities for app development. How the Vision Pro might compare to the success stories that are the Apple Watch and iPad, whether the device really needs a “killer app”, and more are examined. (Part 2)

sleon,2024-01-31,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2v20EpLY1I/,"The review of the #AppleVisionPro by Nilay Patel on The Verge presents it as the most advanced consumer headset to date, yet not without its significant drawbacks. Priced at $3,499, the Vision Pro is positioned by Apple as a pioneer in “spatial computing,” aiming to integrate applications and information seamlessly into the user’s environment. Despite its ambitious vision, the headset faces challenges rooted in its design and functionality. It’s a heavy device, requiring an external battery pack, and presents a series of trade-offs that affect user experience, from hair disruption to the peculiar experience of viewing the world through screens rather than directly with one’s eyes.

The hardware is described as cutting-edge, with a sleek design and impressive display technology, yet it’s criticized for making users feel isolated due to the inherent nature of headsets. The passthrough video feature, while technically impressive, cannot fully replicate the vibrancy and immediacy of direct vision. The control system, based on eye and hand tracking, is innovative but not always reliable, leading to frustration in some instances. Additionally, the Vision Pro’s approach to AR is seen as limited, with most applications running in a “mixed reality” mode that does not fully utilize physical space.

VisionOS, the operating system, leverages the vast iPad app ecosystem but faces limitations in terms of app availability and functionality. The solitary nature of the experience, emphasized by Patel, underlines a significant issue: the Vision Pro, for all its technological achievements, struggles to connect users with their surroundings and with each other, echoing long-standing criticisms of VR technology as isolating.

In conclusion, while the Vision Pro showcases Apple’s engineering prowess and offers glimpses into the future of personal computing, it also highlights the limitations and challenges of making such technology a seamless part of daily life. Patel questions the practicality of replacing traditional computers with a device that, despite its marvels, imposes significant trade-offs on the user experience."

Do not start Apple Vision Pro App.
That’s what I wrote as todo for my indie Apps when planned this week.
It is too early for indie devs and small businesses to invest time and money into development for Apple Vision Pro. Even bigger companies opting out and do not even allow their apps to run in compatibility mode on visionOS.
Most of the indie developers should focuss on iPhone Apps, that’s where most of the users and money is. If Facebook do not see need to support Instagram on iPad unlikelly small indie Apps should inves resources on development for anything else but mobile app.
So, that will be very unpragmatical decision, but most likelly I will develop an App or a few for the Apple Vision Pro later this year anyways. Even without chance to run it on real device.
Curiosity driven development is it :)

The concept, as revealed by a patent from 2007, included sophisticated capabilities such as creating a movie theater or stadium-like experience, with the device responding to head, eye, or hand movements. 

The Vision Pro’s development path included significant milestones, like the acquisition of Canadian MR company Vrvana in 2017 and overcoming various challenges, notably after the departure of key Apple figures like Jony Ive and Evans Hankey. 

Officially announced at Apple’s 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference, the Vision Pro, representing a significant evolution in mixed-reality headsets, began pre-orders in January 2024 with its initial release set for February 2024 in the United States​​​​.

So, who ordered a Vision Pro?! It’s been quite interesting watching all the hype around this device. I just personally have no interest in it just yet. Making an app in a floating 2D window just for the sake of it doesn’t really seem that interesting, and I certainly haven’t seen any clients interested in this from a business perspective just yet.  So my only real interest is purely at a technical level (don’t get me wrong, I really want to try one out!) but as a technical toy I can’t justify the price either 🤣…

I think Vision Pro will truly shine when it comes to more immersive 3D experiences, but that requires 3D design and development skills that are completely different to regular app development. I don’t have the time or patience for that just yet.

I guess I’m happy to not be an early adopter on this one lol.

The pressure mounts as Apple and Meta prepare for their earnings reports. Despite Microsoft’s robust AI contributions to its Azure cloud business, shares dipped, underscoring market expectations for greater revenue. Alphabet faced sharper criticism for missing advertising revenue projections, although its cloud business saw growth.

Alphabet’s CEO highlighted the exponential growth of subscription services, now a $15 billion annual business, and Microsoft revealed its gaming division, including Activision Blizzard, as its third-largest business. The Big Tech parade continues with Apple and Meta’s earnings on Thursday, crucial for assessing iPhone 15 sales and Meta’s advertising rebound.

Apple faces concerns over potential iPhone sales decline in China, impacting its market cap. Changes to the App Store in Europe raise criticism from industry leaders like Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. Additionally, the upcoming launch of Apple’s Vision Pro AR/VR headset could boost revenue but faces pricing skepticism.

Meta experiences a resurgence in its advertising business but grapples with losses in its Reality Labs division. Despite challenges, Meta anticipates potential benefits from Apple’s upcoming headset launch. The market awaits Thursday’s earnings reports to gauge the trajectory of these tech giants.

Though the Apple Vision Pro, which launches tomorrow, doesn’t allow adult apps, it does allow you to connect intimacy toys from Singapore-based company Lovense. Lovense integrated its devices with the headset in an attempt to create a more ""immersive"" form of virtual cuddles, with its app geared towards long-distance couples. As for how it works, one person equips a toy from Lovense, while the other puts on the Vision Pro. The person wearing the headset can then make ""intuitive hand gestures,"" such as the ""grab and shake"" (no, we’re not going to elaborate further on that) which the Vision Pro will detect and transmit to the toy on the other person. Lovense’s app is already available on mobile devices, but the company claims that when used in conjunction with the Vision Pro things seem more natural. Well, as natural as miming a pleasurable act while wearing a headset straight out of “Ready Player One” could be. Would you ever try this? Let us know in the comments.

Based on my pre-launch demo, it very well might. Interacting with and immersing yourself in content is possible in ways once unthinkable, and as with most other Apple devices, the experience just “works” from the moment you put it on.

I got the hang of the new VisionOS operating system pretty quickly, and by the end of my demo, I was convinced that Vision Pro might become the future of inflight entertainment.

All in all, the headset has a ton of potential — so much so that I can’t wait to try it out on my next flight.

But, at $3,499 and with limited battery life, would you consider buying this first generation?"

Let me know if you have questions…"
pcmag,2024-02-02,431,https://www.instagram.com/p/C23DVwlrNRa/,"The Apple Vision Pro just landed, and it promises to be one of the biggest devices of the year. It also has a big price tag. Before you put down $3,499, here are some things to know.

1. The difference between AR and VR can get a bit murky, but in the case of the Vision Pro that’s almost by design as the headset works heavily with both ‘realities’. In other words,  you'll be able to sit on your couch and see your living room as well as the big web browser in front of you, or you can completely replace your living room with a virtual movie theater for ambiance while watching videos.

2. Please don’t wear this everywhere. Aside from the fact that it’s not safe to wear something that can obscure your vision (even if it does have an impressive camera view) it costs $2,399 to repair if you break it – and its battery life is only around 2-2.5 hours anyway.

3. Unlike other VR and AR headsets, the Vision Pro doesn’t make use of a controller to track hand movements. Instead, it relies on cameras and sensors to track hand gestures, along with inward-facing cameras and sensors to track your eye movements. You can connect a keyboard if that’s your thing.

4. Out of the box, the Vision Pro will have access to Apple TV, FaceTime, Messages, Mail, Photos, Safari. It will also have its own App Store and a Disney+ app has already been confirmed for launch.

5. It also supports various streaming services: ESPN, NBA, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, TikTok, and Mubi.

6. The Vision Pro makes use of Apple’s M2 chip, the same M2 chip is used to run the iPad Pro, which we’ve praised for having performance comparable to a laptop, and in the 2023 MacBook Air and 2022 MacBook Pro. Needless to say the Vision Pro won’t be short on processing power.

7. Don’t expect to find Vision Pro at other retailers like Amazon or Best Buy. If you want it, the only place is Apple.

I’ve spent most of my life with technology - social media, text messages notifications sounds and YouTube have soundtracked most of my life 

Yesterday, I tried the Vision Pro early and while there is definitely a lot that will need to be improved before it will be mainstream, holding it, felt like holding a piece of the future 

And once I took it off, my brain was already used to having it on. I found myself wanting to pinch and zoom in on my real world environment! 

That both scares and excites me.

It’s exciting, because I think the most useful technology just effortlessly blends into our lives, but it’s scary when you think about dystopians like Ready Player One

Today is the launch day, and I’m working on an extensive real world review!!:) but my initial thoughts are that if this technology evolves the way phones have over the last 15+ years, we’re in for a future that is accompanied by augmented tech in our daily lives and I’m mostly incredibly excited about that"

morningbrew,2024-02-02,8379,https://www.instagram.com/p/C20v9TNs1aP/,"The Vision Pro hype is getting real. ⁠
⁠
In a profile on Apple's newest product, Vanity Fair dove deep on the revolutionary (and pricey) ""spatial computing"" headset before it hits stores tomorrow. ⁠
⁠
Legendary director James Cameron gushed over his experience with the device, saying, ""I was skeptical at first. I don't bow down before the great god of Apple, but I was really, really blown away."" ⁠
While Cameron definitely didn't have to spend $3,500 to use the tech, his glowing review is one of many. ⁠
⁠
However, despite the variety of use cases it has, others are lamenting drawbacks such as price (no kidding), the weight (20 ounces, which Vanity Fair writer Nick Bilton plainly put, ""That's the same as five sticks of butter—imagine walking around with five sticks of butter on your face all day.""), an external battery pack, and the fact that it's the first generation of a device that stands to see many improvements in coming years. ⁠

The mixed-reality headset’s cheapest version sports 256 GBs of storage for $3,500, while the 512 GB and 1 TB versions will respectively cost $3,700 and $3,900.

Buyers will be required to complete a headscan with their iPhones or iPads to produce a proper fit with the headset, which can also have readers and prescription inserts incorporated into it for $99 and $149, respectively.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who estimated that Apple sold 160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, warned in a blog post of waning demand for the headset after core fans and heavy users make their purchases.

The Vision Pro allows users to access entertainment, work and task-based apps that can be interacted with by wearers while still being able to see the physical space around them if they choose.

TL;DR:

• 2007 Apple Patent: An old patent reveals a design similar to the recently announced Apple Vision Pro.
	
• Surprise Among Apple Fans: Fans are astonished by the resemblance of the 2007 design to the current Vision Pro.

• Speculation About Steve Jobs’ Involvement: Some fans speculate that the Vision Pro is based on ideas from Steve Jobs, not Tim Cook.

• Old Interview with Steve Jobs: Hints of VR technology in an old interview.
	
• Vision Pro as a Modern Product: Despite early ideas, today’s technology in the Vision Pro is more advanced than in Jobs’ era.

Details:

A 2007 Apple patent, recently surfaced, shows a design strikingly similar to the Apple Vision Pro, a VR headset announced in June 2023. 

This design includes elements like an external power source, notably using an iPod in the older concept.

Apple fans are both surprised and impressed by the foresight shown in this patent, hinting at Apple's long-term vision in VR technology. 

The choice of connectors in the Vision Pro, especially the continued use of a Lightning port, sparked humorous comments among fans.

Some speculate that the Vision Pro might stem from ideas by Steve Jobs, supported by an old interview where he discussed interactive glasses. 

However, while these early ideas are intriguing, the advanced technology in today's Vision Pro surpasses what was available in Jobs' time, indicating that it's more a product of recent innovations than solely Jobs' vision.

.
Apple says some upgrades that would be coming to the headset would include watching sports with the best seat in the house. For example, sitting behind first base at a LIVE baseball game or sitting behind the soccer net.
.
Apps like Disney+ have already customized their apps to watch movies and shows on the headset while other companies like Netflix has since refused to do so.

Apple still faces consumer challenges to make big money on this new item release. Things like battery life, the bulk of the product and its cost could restrict Apple in mass releasing this item.

Priced starting at KES 561,000\- this AR experience operates on the new visionOS and is compatible with over a million apps from Apple's app store. 

Controlled by hands, eyes, and voice commands, the headset offers a unique virtual reality experience, but at a higher cost compared to competitors.

Apple also introduced a new Spatial Video format for recording memories using the Vision Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models. However, a global launch date for the Vision pro headset is yet to be announced. 

Thoughts?"

thisissinatra,2024-02-03,17,https://www.instagram.com/p/C25qo2ZOOn1/,"Just finished a Vision Pro demo…from my first demo…I was most impressed by the eye tracking & quick responsiveness of navigating everything by only using my eyes & pinch/hand gestures..that was absolutely incredible. Scrolling through Safari was quick & smooth. Transitioning from my environment in the Apple Store to the immersive environments in the headset was really cool. The sports events views were krazy. Spatial videos were really dope…I felt like I was sitting in the moment that had been captured. (You can only take Spatial videos on the latest iPhone 15 Pros & Apple Vision Pro) The resolution of the icons are super clean. It’s basically a MacBook Headset…but you’re interacting with a computer in a different way...& now I get why they’re calling it “spacial computing”. Obviously VR/AR headsets aren’t a new thing so to drop the bread for a Vision Pro headset right now…you really have to have a reasonable use case to justify the price…or not if you’re ballin like that lol. The build quality definitely sets itself apart from other headsets & Apple has done some other things better with Vision Pro. We all know Apple computers aren’t cheap so the price point for this, as most Apple products, is steep. I never thought I’d pay Apple’s price for AirPods…until I did lol. Apple does things differently & they have their own way of setting themselves apart from their competitors…and it works for them. There’s a reason Apple product drops are like a holiday for a lot of Apple users (🙋🏽‍♂️) lol. If you regularly use any Apple product for work & haven’t experienced the VR/AR space elsewhere much..I think you’ll walk away just as impressed as I was from a demo. Everyone’s use case right now will be different. I think it’s really up to app developers now to push the capabilities even further. I only demo’d the stock apps, which were great, but I’m excited to see what more app developers will bring in the near future. #AppleVisionPro #appleproducts"

He didn’t get into specifics on the call, but any announcements would likely happen at WWDC in June, usually when Apple unveils its newest products. However, it was at WWDC23  that it announced the Vision Pro, which just launched today for $3,500, along with new Macbook Pro laptops.

Mark Gurman from Bloomberg predicts that the upcoming iOS 18 is “seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” Maybe the AI-related announcement is the reason behind the software being so big. Gurman also reported that Apple had been testing AI tools to roll out on its devices, like a ChatGPT-style bot internally referred to as Apple GPT, in addition to a revamped Siri that uses generative AI.

Christian Selig, who previously developed the popular and now-defunct Apollo app for Reddit, became familiar with YouTube’s API while creating Apollo, and has used this knowledge to create an unofficial YouTube app for Vision Pro. It’s called Juno, and for $5 it replicates most of the features of YouTube by allowing you to watch videos, access recommendations, subscriptions and playlists, scrub through content and more. It also takes on Vision Pro aesthetics, like the translucent interface. The only real downside (aside from ads)  is its reliance on YouTube embed APIs: if a video creator disables YouTube embeds, you won't be able to watch that content through this app.

Apple’s Vision Pro is here so let’s explore some more interesting material types.

Today let’s look at “Deep Glass” - how to make it, how to use it in your projects and how to merge it with nice backgrounds.

Playing around with new materials can be a great way for any UX/UI designer to step a little bit out of their comfort zone.

Trying these new things gives you different perspective on app or web designs - and in many cases it leads to beautiful digital products!

Vision Pro’s release by the world’s most iconic device maker is a major milestone for the lovers of virtual or augmented reality, who see the technology as the next chapter in online life after the smartphone.

But with a high sticker price, and the middling success of similar and cheaper releases from Facebook owner Meta, early reviews are unconvincing that the Vision Pro will be a game-changer, at least initially."

mashable,2024-02-03,1603,https://www.instagram.com/p/C23cDz8rlL_/,"With the release of the Vision Pro (especially with its hefty price tag), there are a lot of questions circulating about it. How does this headset fit into real life? In other words, what, exactly, will people use it for?

Our first instinct? You'll be seeing this bad boy on flights — and here are five reasons that back this theory up.

1. It's designed to help users escape
What's better than using a virtual-reality headset that helps you dissociate from the real world? Apple boasts that the Vision Pro lets you watch movies and TV shows inside the headset. Plus, you can control how immersed you want to be by rotating the headset's reality dial.

2. Breakthrough mode
If you don't want to miss the flight attendant passing out snacks and drinks, the Apple Vision Pro has a ""Breakthrough mode"" that lets you see people nearby, even if you're totally immersed.

3. It has a surround-sound audio experience
The Vision Pro has spatial audio, thanks to the audio pods that sit just outside the ears. We haven’t tested them personally, but if these audio pods are as immersive as Apple claims, they may be a game changer for in-flight entertainment.

4. It has a mindfulness app
Flying can be stressful AF. Between TSA, delays, and the chaos of boarding, airports can be a hassle. Fortunately, the Vision Pro has a mindfulness app, helping users create a moment of calm amidst all the frenetic activity.

5. After spending $3,499, users will want to show it off
While Apple tries to market the Vision Pro has a home-bound device that serves as an immersive extension of the Apple ecosystem, there's no way in hell big spenders are going to let their $4,000 luxury headset collect dust in their living rooms. You best believe they'll be taking the Vision Pro outside, and the most practical place to wear the Vision Pro is on flights.

At first, onlookers will snort at early adopters adorning these funky head-mounted displays on flights. However, we theorize that these Vision Pro pioneers will eventually kick off a trend that will one day destigmatize the act of wearing headsets in public."

Apple Vision Pro
The $3,500 price tag and Apple’s plan for a go-slow approach when it begins selling the headsets will temper any immediate revolution.

The Next GPT
A big upgrade from the company could come in the new year, though nothing is official yet.

A New Nintendo Switch
While Nintendo isn’t saying anything about its plans for a gaming console, all signs point to the release of a Switch successor in time for the holiday season. 

Tesla’s Cybertruck
The first deliveries are already trickling out, but 2024 will be a make-or-break year for Tesla Inc.’s new truck, which has to contend with increasing competition and an odd design that could keep some buyers away.

Qi2 Wireless Charging
Faster and safer, Qi2 could become a universal standard

Disc-Less Xboxes
The slimmer Xboxes fit into Microsoft’s current go-anywhere, play-on-anything credo.

Humane’s AI Pin
Starting at $700, this lapel pin projects information onto your palm and recognizes hand gestures and voice controls. 

The Next Huawei Phone
Huawei Technologies Co. shocked US policymakers in August with the release of a handset with its own made-in-China processor, showing off the resilience of the country’s chip industry.

adamhelweh,2024-02-04,7,https://www.instagram.com/p/C27v0rXPnn5/,"The current standout app that really shows what the Vision Pro is capable of is … Fruit Ninja. 

It mapped my whole room out on its own, walls, furniture, floor, ottoman, etc. 

The squished fruit splatters accurately went on top of my sofa, lap, and other surfaces. 

The fruit also landed and rolled off the surfaces differently based on their height. 

I threw shuriken around the room. They stuck in my walls and cieling accurately and did not move or jitter when I moved my head. 

When I tossed the bamboo stick to the pig it accurately bounced off of the furniture or stayed on the ottoman. The pig traversed the room, ninja teleporting to higher spots as needed. 

The pig walked around the ottoman and stopped before going under my entertainment center to get the bamboo. 

Multiple hand gestures were used to make different actions happen. Shuriken, lightening, spells all had different ventures that were recognized fast and accurately with no controllers. 

Was it perfect? Nope. For example, I could still see the pig even though he was behind the ottoman. But I think my kind would have exploded if I as that happen. I anticipate a software update could change that. 

However, this game shows how well the Vision Pro handles the space it’s in and what’s possible. Not one second did I need to tell it where I was, let it scan the room, etc. as Apple products usually do, it just worked. 

I’m excited to see what other apps come out in forthcoming months. Especially if this is the ground floor.

Justifying the hefty $3,500 price tag, Cook stated the Vision Pro is ""tomorrow's technology today.""

During a visit to the Fifth Avenue store, Cook discussed the newly-released gadget and shared his thoughts on what it means for the future in an interview with Good Morning America. 

""I think it's going to be used in so many different ways because it's a spatial computer,"" Cook told co-host Michael Strahan.

""You know, the iPhone introduced us to the mobile computer. The Mac introduced us to personal computers. This is the first spatial computer. A company only has a few of these. Most companies have none. We've had the Mac, the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone, the Apple Watch, and now the Vision Pro. It's one of those moments,"" the 63-year-old CEO added.

Cook continued to describe the product as ""tomorrow's technology today."" ""It's packed with, we have 5,000 patents on the product already. So we really leaned into it. And I'm hoping some people will pay for it by month, some people will just buy it,"" Cook said.

""I have talked to a lot of people in line, they're just going to buy it. But over time, who knows what will happen? But we think we priced it for the right value today,"" the Apple CEO added.

Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared at the company’s flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City on Friday morning to celebrate the headset’s release. Speaking to CNBC’s Jim Cramer at the event about the Vision Pro’s high sticker price, Cook called it “tomorrow’s technology today.” The Vision Pro starts at $3,500.

“People can spread their payments out over time, and so that’s one affordability kind of thing,” Cook said, referring to a monthly financing plan that buyers can choose. “It’s chock-full of invention. It’s got 5,000 patents on it.”

“We think we priced it at the right level considering the value of it,” Cook added.

On Apple’s earnings call Thursday, Cook said the Vision Pro is also being embraced as an enterprise product, citing companies including Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP that “have started leveraging and investing” in the headset as a platform for customers and workers.

Still, Cook said Thursday that he believes Apple can remain “both” a consumer- and enterprise-focused company going forward with the Vision Pro now among its offerings, considering the gadget’s “ton of use cases.” He said more than 600 apps and games are available on the headset that are specifically designed to provide a “spatial computing” experience.

A man who bought an Apple Vision Pro for $3,500 recorded his daily use of the device.

Reminds me of something I read once..

“Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.

Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society.

The payoff for this self-imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.”

I’ve had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in Apple Vision Pro, and explore what it has to offer. I lived through a similar moment in history with iPhone, and can confidently say this is another apex moment in our timeline.

The surreal feeling of the digital world on top of your own (or completely isolating you into your own digital world, going between each) is something that is impossible to describe without you trying it for yourself. I encourage you to go to the Apple Store and book a demo session with it, it will blow your mind.

For context, in the first clip, my music video appears 20 feet wide to me, there’s nothing like seeing something you created the size of a cinema screen. I FEEL like I’m out in the desert in the sun setting, and I’m able to browse my own website 10 feet tall on the side perfectly with my eyes and hands only. My hands are perfectly occluded over top of the image, with a lighting map perfectly coloring my arms to the light of the background content. I’m fully immersed. 

It’s truly special and a profound experience everyone should have. I’m speechless and forever changed. Apple Vision Pro is insanely great."

jthrasher,2024-02-04,160,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2584RdsVZ9/,"I got to demo the Apple Vision Pro today. It was incredible, and here are my quick thoughts:

- Your experience will depend on one thing: have you already worn and used an Oculus/Quest? If so, this won’t be an overwhelmingly different experience for you. If you haven’t used an Oculus/Quest, be prepared to have your mind absolutely blown at the technology!
- The eye tracking to select menus/buttons is literal magic. It felt like I had a super power. I felt like one of the X-Men. It never got old and I was constantly amazed throughout the 20 minutes by this alone.
- The resolution of the visuals is extraordinary. I had an Oculus, and this, as you might expect, makes the Oculus display feel OLD. It’s like you’ve been using a Super Nintendo and upgraded to a Switch. 
- Spatial Photos and Spatial Video demonstrated in this took my breath away. It feels like you are in your memories and I was literally speechless. Words/reviews can’t describe this - you must experience this for yourself.
- Part of the demo showcased the VR experience on top of a goal post in a soccer game, and then from the field of a baseball game. It was SO lifelike and high resolution, I got emotional. Again, it’s like nothing you’ve ever experienced!

None of this justifies a $3,500 price tag in my opinion. Apple consistently called it a computer and referenced “spatial computing.” I think this device is for a niche group right now: people who consume a lot of content and travel a lot for work. I would LOVE to use this on a plane if I traveled a lot. 

Ask me anything below if you have questions! Are you going to get one?

A man who bought an Apple Vision Pro for $3,500 recorded his daily use of the device.

Reminds me of something I read once..

“Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.

Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society.

The payoff for this self-imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.”

apple vision pro is meant for home and to explore around you. it’s just a bit too early for all of this tech because we as a society are struggling to get by everyday. we need a lifestyle shift to balance out all of the innovation from the last decade.

let’s figure out how these companies can help with student loans and universal health care before we worry about escaping reality.

which in essence was never what these products were intended to do. your devices are meant to be enjoyed and inspire you to create. we just have been approaching things the wrong way.

let’s figure out how to onboard the elderly to web 2.0 without leaving any one behind. let’s shake up the healthcare system or create third places in our communities by supporting small businesses.

let’s focus on bringing back 2016 vibes in the present. then we can focus on the future.

tonsil,2024-02-04,9007,https://www.instagram.com/p/C28Nas6OKpa/,"The First Look Into the Future: Apple Vision Pro

Since the release of the iPhone in 2007, we haven’t seen hype surrounding a first generation Apple product like there’s been for their newest product, the ‘Apple Vision Pro’.

The product itself could be coined as a “Virtual Reality” or a “VR headset”, but it’s just a few steps ahead of the technology we’ve already been familiar with in the space for almost a decade. These differences are exactly why Apple chose to name the product a “Vision Pro” and categorize it as a the worlds first “Spatial Computer”.

Now it may seem like Apple just jumped onto the scene, but back in 2007, the company actually patented similar plans to create the product we see today, they just took advantage of the space growing and waited until the perfect opportunity to launch it.

Often times when new technological breakthroughs happen, people like to say “we live in Black Mirror”, and that’s exactly the reaction many people have had in the past few days. The headset itself, allows users to see clearly into the world around them using cameras on the outside, all while implementing aspects of traditional VR.

The most concerning thing about the Vision Pro though, is a statement many who’ve worn it have commonly said. YouTubers like Casey Neistat & MKBHD, have stated that after awhile of wearing the headset, it begins to blend in with reality, with the wearer forgetting they even have a $3500 VR headset on, opening up the possibilities for people to wear these all day and not think twice about it.

Seeing as this is the first generation, and will be the least advanced version of the Vision Pro, it’s eerie yet also exciting to see what comes next. It radishes the question of how we as a society will integrate this tech into our daily lives. As the computers inside the headsets continue to get smaller, could we see a vast percentage of society utilizing it, everyday?"

“It’s chock-full of invention. It’s got 5,000 patents on it” says Tim Cook, CEO

Looking back nearly two decades, it’s shocking to see the Vision Pro come to fruition based on the language used in the patent filing:

“The personal display system may include an electronic device operative to provide media to a personal display device operative to display the received media. Using one or more optical and digital components, the personal display device may adjust displayed media to overlay features of a theater, thus giving the user of the personal display device the impression of being in the theater”.

“In some embodiments, the personal display device may detect the user’s movements using one or more sensors and may adjust the displayed image based on the user’s movements.

Joseph Ravichandran, a PhD student from MIT with expertise in microarchitecture security, claims to have identified a critical kernel vulnerability in the device’s operating system, visionOS. This vulnerability could potentially enable jailbreaking and the development of harmful software designed to exploit this new hardware.

I can’t wait to see what we will have a few generations later. I hope that will be really something we could wear on the go and use comfortably and not just for views.
I’m still not planning improve current Apps for AVP, but definettely will keep that im mind as soon as I will start working on the new one.

He did a realistic durability test of the headset by bumping into things and dropping it from up to over 10 feet/3 meters.

The results are rather surprising and the front glass of Vision Pro is very sturdy. The things that seem to break more easily are the speakers and the strap. In general, even after all the rough things that happened to it, the headset was functional after the tests.

Do not start Apple Vision Pro App.
That’s what I wrote as todo for my indie Apps when planned this week.
It is too early for indie devs and small businesses to invest time and money into development for Apple Vision Pro. Even bigger companies opting out and do not even allow their apps to run in compatibility mode on visionOS.
Most of the indie developers should focuss on iPhone Apps, that’s where most of the users and money is. If Facebook do not see need to support Instagram on iPad unlikelly small indie Apps should inves resources on development for anything else but mobile app.
So, that will be very unpragmatical decision, but most likelly I will develop an App or a few for the Apple Vision Pro later this year anyways. Even without chance to run it on real device.
Curiosity driven development is it :)

To me, what you experience in it is the semi-distant future of computing. This isn’t available in the way we need it for mass adoption so we have it in this format. Remove the idea of the headset (which really isn’t as heavy as people say per how long you’d use it). Now think of interacting with your computer using your eyes and hands and voice alone. The goal is set - this (like a lot of what Apple has done in the past) is training. ;) #applevisionpro"

And where do I even begin…

To say that this device has the potential to completely change the way we work and interact is an understatement.

But it does have its flaws, much like any new piece of technology.

Similar to the first version of the iPhone, this Gen 1 device is probably the worst version that Apple will ever ship. The weight distribution is uneven, battery life is not the greatest, and let’s face it – the thing looks goofy on your face.

However, when you look beyond the initial flaws, the underlying technology and business implications coming to this rapidly evolving realm of spatial computing is mind-boggling.

Apple sets trends, and there’s no doubt that they took their time figuring this one out…and this is just the beginning.

Unboxing and recap video coming soon!

cryptoculture.in,2024-02-05,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/C299EpjsKDm/,"The crypto-meets-virtual reality (VR) developer Victoria VR says it's working to release the first metaverse app from a blockchain-related company on the Apple headset ""Vision Pro.""
The project's metaverse consists of ""ultra-realistic graphics and immersive gameplay,"" which will be able to supplement Vision Pro's technologies, the company said in a statement on Friday.

Victoria VR's metaverse is driven by its VR token, which will reward its active users and stakers, the firm said. The token is based on Ethereum, under the blockchain's ERC-20 standard.

Half the revenue generated from in-game asset sales will be redistributed to stakers and active metaverse users.

""Victoria VR’s in-app economy is fueled by the VR token, used to incentivize activities that enhance the virtual environment for the benefit of all participants,"" according to the press release.
The VR token has surged nearly 60% in the last 24 hours and has $103 million in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data.

According to a white paper posted on the project's website, ""We want Victoria VR to be accessible to all, and so citizens will be able to earn Victoria VR by simply taking part in the world. It will be “pay-to-speed” not “pay-to- win.""

""These ERC20 Tokens will be our primary source of generating revenue during the start of the project,"" the white paper reads.

Working on Vision Pro | Patent image versus reality
Vision Pro may only have been announced this year, and go on sale in 2024, but we’ve known for many years that the company was working on a product of this kind. What we didn’t know was quite how many years.

A newly-published patent reveals the answer to that question – at least since 2007, the year that the original iPhone launched.

Of course, the 2007 patent doesn’t describe the entirety of Vision Pro’s capabilities. Specifically, it describes using a headset to display movies and sports events – but even then, it includes reference to doing so in a virtual reality setting and describes some surprisingly sophisticated capabilities.

The patent describes how the headset would give the illusion of sitting in a movie theater.

The personal display system may include an electronic device operative to provide media to a personal display device operative to display the received media.

Using one or more optical and digital components, the personal display device may adjust displayed media to overlay features of a theater, thus giving the user of the personal display device the impression of being in the theater.

It’s also not the case that this is a just a dumb viewing device. Even back in 2007, Apple envisaged that it would respond to head, eye, or hand movements.

Menurut Cook, harga Vision Pro sudah sepadan dengan teknologi dan fitur yang ditawarkannya. Dalam sebuah wawancara di program Good Morning America, Cook menjelaskan bahwa perangkat ini adalah teknologi masa depan yang sudah dapat dinikmati saat ini. Ia menekankan bahwa perangkat tersebut telah diisi dengan teknologi mutakhir, dan Apple telah memiliki 5.000 paten terkait produk tersebut.

Cook menyampaikan harapannya bahwa beberapa orang akan memilih untuk membayar per bulan, sementara yang lain akan langsung membeli perangkat tersebut. Meskipun untuk ke depannya masih menjadi tanda tanya, Apple meyakini bahwa harga yang diberikan sesuai dengan nilai perangkat saat ini.

It blew my mind.

What you see in the demos is nothing compared to when you try it on for the first time. This is probably what the holodeck is going to be like. As close to sci-fi as you can get with today’s technology. The things we saw a decade ago in Minority Report are now here. The 3D movies bring you to the underwater world of Avatar. When a rhino approached me, I instinctively moved backwards. And when I was in the cliffs of a mountain in Norway and I looked down, I felt scared that I was going to fall.

Is the product perfect, definitely not. Still feels like a beta. But does it wow. Definitely.  This is a gadget that only Apple can make. It’s magical how it works. Will I plunk $3500 for it? Not yet. I want to see how its usage evolves over months. If this was $1500 I would no doubt shout, take my money. Will this herald a better future? Uhm.

I’m not sure about that. I shudder at the thought of the dystopian world of Ready Player One where everyone was strapped into one of these. 

For now, I’ll take a step back and work on my EQ. Patience and let’s see. Maybe this might be a Christmas gift I’ll give myself.

A day after the release of Apple‘s latest product, the Apple Vision Pro, a security concern has emerged. Joseph Ravichandran, a PhD student from MIT with expertise in microarchitecture security, claims to have identified a critical kernel vulnerability in the device’s operating system, visionOS. This vulnerability could potentially enable jailbreaking and the development of harmful software designed to exploit this new hardware.

This is a tutorial you can follow along in both Figma or Sketch (I used Sketch but it’s tool agnostic)

There are THREE main things to remember:
✅ Vision PRO renders only the direct center of vision sharp and the things around blurry. That is on purpose to make it feel more realistic. Use it!

✅ When designing on a real photo, see where the light is coming from - in our case through a doorway on the left. Adjust the gradient border to be lighter there.

✅ The color of the main window and panels is not a specific color that’s the same every time. Adjust it to the lighting conditions in the environment. Also make sure to add a 20% dark fill onto your background photo for a better result.

Want me to more of these explorations? Leave a comment - when we reach 100 comments I’ll work on another tutorial for you!

I'm quite envious of all the Vision Pro reviews. 😭 Jokes aside, having watched numerous videos about this device, in my opinion, it will cater mainly to professional users and may not transition into a consumer tech product. 😅

The major issue, in my view, lies in the fact that the experience is heavily reliant on our current devices, lacking a genuinely new way to interact with apps. 📲

As an example, Apple Maps appears to be just a larger version of the iOS and iPadOS application. I envisioned a completely innovative approach to exploring streets, for instance. 🗺️

While there are many aspects of this viewer that I absolutely love, with some unique Apple touches, this is my overall perspective on the future of these products.

What's your take on this new Apple product? 👀🤿"

Despite China's dismissal of these claims, evidence from cybersecurity firms and criminal indictments underlines the serious nature of the threat. (Source: Sky News)

The Apple Vision Pro, at $3,499, showcases groundbreaking spatial computing with an exceptional display and seamless Apple ecosystem integration. However, its high cost, reliance on an external battery, and the isolation it creates underscore significant drawbacks.

The sale, slated to complete by January 31, 2025, follows Amazon's recovery from a challenging 2022, marked by cost-cutting and layoffs under CEO Andy Jassy.

Scepticism behind the ethics of this gadget are not unfounded, for the prevalence of Vision Pro would also bring massive privacy concerns.

Working on Vision Pro | Patent image versus reality
Vision Pro may only have been announced this year, and go on sale in 2024, but we’ve known for many years that the company was working on a product of this kind. What we didn’t know was quite how many years.

A newly-published patent reveals the answer to that question – at least since 2007, the year that the original iPhone launched.

Of course, the 2007 patent doesn’t describe the entirety of Vision Pro’s capabilities. Specifically, it describes using a headset to display movies and sports events – but even then, it includes reference to doing so in a virtual reality setting and describes some surprisingly sophisticated capabilities.

The patent describes how the headset would give the illusion of sitting in a movie theater.

The personal display system may include an electronic device operative to provide media to a personal display device operative to display the received media.

Using one or more optical and digital components, the personal display device may adjust displayed media to overlay features of a theater, thus giving the user of the personal display device the impression of being in the theater.

It’s also not the case that this is a just a dumb viewing device. Even back in 2007, Apple envisaged that it would respond to head, eye, or hand movements.

And over 200,000 freaks who need to touch some grass have reportedly already secured their own ‘mixed reality’ headset.

Apple unveiled the new device back in June 2023, and nobody really cared because it will likely result in net zero positive impact for society unless we can somehow encourage potential school shooters to focus on this “ultimate entertainment experience” instead of the real thing.

The Apple Vision Pro is apparently designed to “bring the virtual world into the real world” through digital content and spatial computing.

Users just slide the headset on over their head and use their eyes, hands and voice to interact with the computer system.

One of our town’s richest nerds Nigel Blewitt (25, Betoota West) has already gotten his hands - and face - onto one of these dystopian brain holidays. He says it’s awesome.

“Man, the Apple Vision is incredible!” he tells The Betoota Advocate today.

“Being the first person to have a new device like this is always fun, but the headset itself is great”

When asked what he plans on doing in this mixed reality, Nigel says the options are limitless, before listing a whole range of different activities that he could easily take part in for a lot less money in the actual real world.

“Everything” he says.

“Well, not, everything”

“I mean I’m not using it to immerse myself into POV pornography, if that’s what you are inferring”

“Just today I was on a boat out past the heads and reeling in a marlin! I’ve never done that before”

Nigel’s long-suffering father, overhearing this conversation from the kitchen, sighs.

“Why did you need to spend four grand to go fishing?!” he barks, from behind his newspaper, which has been printed on paper and delivered to his house by a teenager on a bicycle.

Nigel scoffs at this comment, as he blindly grabs at the air in his childhood bedroom.

“Because dad, this is more real than fishing”

The old man retorts back at his stay-at-home son.

“No it’s not. You could’ve bought top of the line rods, bait and a fucken boat for that money”"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, Apple has once again taken a giant leap forward with the introduction of its groundbreaking product, the Apple Vision Pro.

This revolutionary device signifies Apple’s foray into augmented reality (AR), bringing a host of features and capabilities that promise to redefine our digital interactions.

Apple Vision Pro is built on cutting-edge augmented reality technology, leveraging advanced sensors, cameras, and a powerful processing unit. This device seamlessly integrates with Apple’s ecosystem, enhancing the overall user experience.

The device, which costs a whopping $3,500, has already hit the stores and attracted much attention. Some people are eager to try out the new possibilities of spatial computing.
One of the most basic examples of spatial reality is the game Pokemon Go, which takes place in the real world and lets the gamers interact with the Pokemon as if they are a part of their environment. The concept of spatial computing goes hand in hand with virtual and augmented reality.

Spatial computing is a mix between real and virtual experiences. The Apple Vision Pro captures data from the real surroundings of a user and processes into a 3D map, which is called spatial mapping.

無論如何 ⋯ 《辛普森家庭》是再次預測到這個未來了 😆👾！

🔻 這就是我們的未來嗎？

蘋果要價美金 $3,499 的 Vision Pro 上週末正式在美國開賣，這個光是預購就突破 20 萬台的 MR 頭戴裝置也正式席捲了大街小巷、室內室外、以及社群媒體。餐桌上沒有人在滑手機，因為大家都沈浸在 Vision Pro 的世界；特斯拉的駕駛則開啟全自動輔助駕駛 (FSD) 繼續使用 Vision Pro；過馬路的行人也突然停下來對空中揮舞。種種片段就讓網友表示「非常危險」並表示這些亂象根本是濫用科技。

🔻 煮菜、做家事、彈鋼琴都變的超方便？

雖然網路上有不少危險的示範，然而也有不少人分享了 Vision Pro 帶來的便利性。像是利用它來的按鍵和節奏來彈鋼琴、把吸塵器加入「小精靈吃能量球」的互動讓你不漏掉任何一塊區域之外也很有趣、或是在廚房直接投影食譜或是煮菜教學等等。這些功能就被認為相當吸引人！

此外，比較爭議的功能則還有 DeepFake 技術。透過換臉你將可以直接把你的另一半的臉變成你的偶像，被認為是一種「要不毀滅、要不拯救一段感情」的功能。

🔻 其實我們都活在《辛普森家庭》的世界

不過早在 2016 年時，《辛普森家庭》就預言到了頭戴裝置將會滲透日常生活的未來了。S28EP2 的 Friends & Family 中，就展示了所有人在路上都宛如喪屍、戴著裝置的畫面。雖然當時是因應 Oculus Rift 的 VR 頭套，但是因為普及程度完全不如這次 Vision Pro，因此反而更類似於如今美國街道上不時出現的狀況？儘管如此，依舊不免讓人感到毛骨悚然，到底有哪些東西是《辛普森家庭》沒有預測到的呢？

theatlantic,2024-02-05,1905,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2-7qpJMDYw/,"The Apple Vision Pro wants to reconcile life outside the computer and life within it. The challenge might be insurmountable, Ian Bogost writes.⁠
⁠
The headset, which sells for $3,499 and up, is finally available after months of hype. It offers two innovations in one, Bogost reports: “a virtual-reality (VR) headset with a higher resolution than most others on the market, and an array of augmented-reality (AR) cameras that allow a wearer to see ordinary computer applications floating in space, and to interact with them via hand gestures. To make the AR work, a knob on the top of the device can dial back your level of ‘immersion’ in a simulated space and replace it with a live video feed of your surroundings, overlaid in real time with computer programs: web browsers, spreadsheets, photo viewers, Disney+. It’s this latter function that most distinguishes the device from other headsets—and from other machines in general. Computers help people work, live, and play, but they also separate us from the world. Apple Vision Pro strives to end that era and inaugurate a new one.”⁠
⁠
When Bogost put the headset on, he found “a rapidly updating computer-desktop-background version of the world, rather than a view of things as they really are.” It made him physically ill. “I began to feel afraid, like I’d gone so deep inside computerspace that I would never get out again … Augmented reality is supposed to increase your sense of place compared with VR, but I’ve tried the older, lower-resolution options—the Meta Quest, the HTC Vive—and the Apple Vision Pro made me feel even more decoupled from the world.”⁠
⁠
“At what may have been the height of the internet’s thrall, it became popular to pretend that the digital and material worlds were continuous—that the ‘real’ one had no special meaning, because cyberspace had become a part of it,” Bogost continues at the link in our bio. “That turned out to be wrong. We live in cars and on couches and, separately, we also live on phones. Apple believes it can resolve this conflict … but it has only put the conflict into higher resolution. A headset is a pair of spectacles, but a headset is also a blindfold.”⁠

francismir,2024-02-05,1,https://www.instagram.com/tv/C28zlvpg68c/,"As a certified techno-geek, I have always been fascinated by the wonders of technology. My love for gadgets runs so deep that my house is voice-activated, resembling a Star Trek starship more than an ordinary living space. So naturally, when the new Apple Vision Pro hit the market, I was among the first to don the headset and dive into its virtual world. It was a surreal experience, transporting me to different realms just like a Star Trek holodeck, offering me an escape from reality.

But once the initial thrill subsided, a nagging thought crept in - would this technological marvel bring us together or push us further apart? In a world where we're already engrossed in the screens of our smartphones, losing ourselves in the rhythm of taps and scrolls, would a device designed to isolate us even more be a step in the right direction? The Apple Vision Pro, while impressive, seemed to blur the lines between connection and disconnection, between reality and virtuality.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for technological advancement. But it's crucial to remember that technology should enhance our humanity, not replace it. It should bring us closer, not create chasms of isolation. It should be a tool for communication, not a barrier. As we continue to ride the wave of technological innovation, let's not forget the warmth of a human touch, the joy of face-to-face conversations, and the magic of shared experiences. Because at the end of the day, no gadget can replicate the beauty of human connection. #TechVsHumanity #StayConnected #RealWorldOverVirtual #unapologetic #unapologeticdude #mirandism"

During an earnings call yesterday, Apple’s chief exec emphasized its ongoing investment in AI, alongside other — as he put it — “groundbreaking innovation”, such as the technologies which underpin Apple’s Vision Pro VR/AR headset, saying: “We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”

There was no more steer on when exactly Cupertino will pull back the curtain on its AI efforts. But its annual developer confab, WWDC, typically takes place in June — and will certainly be one date to watch for any big reveals here.

The new Apple VR headsets have hit the open market, and look set to herald a new era of human experience.

The $3500 piece of technology is supposed to allow users to experience a new mixed reality.

While some tech bloggers were sceptical about the price of the headset, it’s been confirmed that it can now allow some people to live out their dreams.

It’s been revealed that the Apple Vision Pro headsets actually allow Tesla drivers to watch themselves getting ploughed by Elon Musk while sitting in the drivers seat of their moving car.

Images have gone viral this week of people allowing the Tesla to pretty much drive itself, while they watch hectic deep fake AI videos of themselves having sexual intercourse with Elon.

“Wow, it’s the most incredible experience I’ve ever had,” said one driver under the promise of anonymity today.

“I got from Brisbane to Noosa just watching a feature length film of me and the great man wrapped in the thralls of love making.”

“I can really put it into words.”

Authorities have since requested that people only watch the Deep Fake pornos of themselves 69ing Elon in the frunk of a Cyber Truck while they are in the confines of their own home.

[decode] 

This device, is not a lens, so you can not see through it. You are seeing a screen, the images that you are viewing are recorded by a camera and displayed into your eyes. This is one step removed from full MATRIX control. I would theorize your eye sight would be diminished from non stop screen viewing. This will make way for BRAIN CHIPS and more augmented reality devices. 

Once you are bored with this device broadcasting reality into your eyes, you will want to change what you see. NEW or alternative places around the world will be advertised. Soon after [they] will offer consciousness transfer and fully place you into the matrix / META VERSE.. Currency within the META VERSE will be carbon credits and tokens.
YOU WILL OWN NOTHING and BE HAPPY from drugs and mood altering stimulation by these devices.. 

Everything done according to your FREE-WILL, and will be done voluntarily....

WE being the ones who see this control system coming will be the ones who refuse it. All the people who were vaccinated will feel the urge to get one of these devices and alter their meaningless existence. After the cell phones are replaced with these devices we will then be able to identify those not plugged into the NEW WORLD ORDER control system..

The A.I. will be able to direct the user to do anything needed to accomplish the goals of a full takeover. 

THIS IS THE SATANIC TAKEOVER OF MANKIND. 

Once these people sell their homes and possessions for these carbon / meta verse credits, they will only be able to spend them inside the matrix system. FINAL DAYS ARE NOT COMING THEY ARE HERE.

The Vision Pro is sold out, preventing me from going into debt to acquire something I don't know if I'll use right now, but I can book a demo if I want to at least take it for a spin (I'll think about it). I might've acquired a t-shirt... or two... I need the old OS X glass Apple logo on a shirt, that was a nice logo. Still, I can now say I've been here, almost like a pilgrimage or something."

剛剛 Apple 在北美地區正式發佈他們的全新頭戴式裝置 Vision Pro ，雖然 Vision Pro價格並不便宜，但卻沒有影響產品銷情，不但有一眾 Apple 粉絲入坑，而且在北美街頭各處也幾乎也能看到 Vision Pro 的出現。

作為 Apple 首款推出的 VR 頭戴裝置，Apple Vision Pro 是一部充滿突破性的裝置設計，根據Apple官方表示，此裝置是讓 app 超越傳統顯示器的限制，帶來全 3D 介面，以最自然、直覺的輸入方式操控，讓用戶與數碼內容在空間中有如實體內容般互動。雖然 Apple Vision Pro 的售價高達 $3,499 美元 (近27,000港元），但創新獨特的體驗卻吸引到不少玩家排隊購買！

透過社交媒體，我們可以看到這款不少人已經在歐美的街頭上戴上這款 Apple Vision Pro 在街頭、地鐵甚至是游泳池上行走，不但印證着虛擬實境時代的來臨，也反映出它的受歡迎程度。

在現時講求未來感、科技感的Y2K潮流下，不少人也紛紛戴上耳機、戴上前衛設計的太陽眼鏡來迎合這股風潮，而外形同樣充滿未來感的 Apple Vision Pro 也恰恰能呼應這股風潮，Vision Pro 將會陸續在不同地方開賣，不知道它會不會成為下一個新潮物呢？

Apple’s design conveys a touchable sense of the future. Its universality combined with customization makes it suitable for everyone, and the ability to integrate prescription lenses enhances its inclusivity.

As apps and platforms compatible with Apple Vision Pro advance, we’ll witness an exponential growth in new experiences and services seamlessly integrating the digital and physical worlds.

In use, the Optic ID feature is what the Vision Pro uses in order to authenticate the wearer and ensure that they are the person whose Apple ID is associated with the headset. That allows the Vision Pro to block access to apps and data if it doesn’t believe that the person wearing it is its owner.. 

They will have your complete data collection perfectly paired and verified. You are done❗️stay away from this shit. Use some critical thinking.

“What Orwell failed to predict was that we’d buy the cameras ourselves, and that our biggest fear would be that nobody was watching.” 

- Keith Jensen

This week Apple’s biggest product innovation in years hit American shelves. The Apple Vision Pro; spatial computing, augmented reality goggles. Spatial computing meaning, you don’t need a keyboard, or a mouse. You move the mouse” with your eyes, you wave your hands around in the air to click. To someone watching from the outside, it looks like someone who is “seeing things’’ that aren’t there. It’s like the first times you saw or heard someone having a conversation with airpods in and it seemed like they were talking to themselves. So yes, there is a moment of cultural adjustment that is happening, and it will be common for folks to poke fun at the early adopters who are trying these things out in public. These devices are $3500 right now and are chunky and clunky. The Apple true believers are rushing in to try them out. The rest of us are standing on the sidelines watching. 

So are these things going to catch on? Or is this just another dead end product experiment? 

My sense is, this is gen 1, these devices will become much cheaper and sleeker in the next few years. Augmented reality will be ubiquitous in a few years time. If that is so, I want to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the topic. The iPhone had a historic impact on the way we live and interact with each other and “the more than human world”. My sense is, this technologically will take that to another level and we need to be ready. (Rest of blog in link in bio)."

หลังจากปล่อยให้แฟน ๆ รอคอยกันมานาน ในที่สุด แอปเปิล วิชัน โปร (Apple Vision Pro) อุปกรณ์แว่นตาอัจฉริยะ ที่ผสมผสานโลกความจริงและโลกเสมือนเข้าด้วยกัน ก็ได้ฤกษ์วางจำหน่ายอย่างเป็นทางการแล้วในประเทศสหรัฐอเมริกาเมื่อวันศุกร์ที่ 2 กุมภาพันธ์ที่ผ่านมา ซึ่งก็ได้การตอบรับเป็นอย่างดี และยังมีเสียงจากนักวิเคราะห์ที่ชี้ว่าอุปกรณ์ชิ้นนี้ สามารถผสมผสานการใช้งานอุปกรณ์คอมพิวเตอร์และทีวีไว้ด้วยกันได้ดีทีเดียว

สำหรับแว่นตาอัจฉริยะ Apple Vision Pro เป็นอุปกรณ์ชุดแว่นตาที่ใช้เทคโนโลยีที่ผสมผสานเนื้อหาดิจิทัลแบบสามมิติ เข้ากับโลกแห่งความเป็นจริง หรือที่เรียกว่า Mixed Reality (MR) มาพร้อมจุดเด่นคือชิปประมวลผลที่พัฒนาเป็นพิเศษ และหน้าจอที่เลียนแบบการผลิตได้ยาก 

โดยสำนักข่าวรอยเตอร์ (Reuters) รายงานว่า หลังจากที่มีนักวิเคราะห์ได้ลองใช้งานแว่นตาอัจฉริยะนี้ พวกเขาพบว่าคุณลักษณะเหล่านี้ อาจทำให้มันมาแทนที่ และพลิกโฉมการใช้งานของคอมพิวเตอร์และทีวีแบบเดิม ๆ ได้

อย่างไรก็ตาม รอยเตอร์ยังรายงานถึงบทวิเคราะห์ของ นักวิเคราะห์จาก เบิร์นสไตน์ รีเสิร์ช (Bernstein Research) ซึ่งเป็นบริษัทวิจัยตลาดและการลงทุนที่มีชื่อเสียง ที่ระบุว่า อุปกรณ์แว่นตาอัจฉริยะนี้อาจทำยอดขายได้ไม่ดีนักสำหรับลูกค้าทั่วไปในช่วงแรกโดยอ้างอิงจากการที่บริษัทได้แจ้งยอดเตรียมผลิตแว่นตาเพียงแค่ 1 ล้านเครื่องเท่านั้น ชี้ให้เห็นถึงความไม่มั่นใจว่าผู้บริโภคจะซื้อสินค้าทันที โดยที่ไม่ผ่านการทดลองใช้งานในร้านค้าก่อน

แต่ในทางกลับกัน นักวิเคราะห์มองว่า ราคาที่สูงถึงเครื่องละ 3,500 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐฯ หรือประมาณ 125,000 บาท จะไม่ได้เป็นอุปสรรคสำคัญสำหรับผู้ซื้อในภาคธุรกิจ และในท้ายที่สุดแล้วมันอาจจะกลายเป็นแพลตฟอร์มคอมพิวเตอร์แบบใหม่ เช่นเดียวกับเมื่อครั้งที่ แมค (Mac) เปิดตัวครั้งแรกอีกทั้งยังมองว่าการเปิดตัวแว่นตาอัจฉริยะนี้ เป็นกลยุทธ์ที่สำคัญสำหรับอนาคตของแอปเปิล ในยุคที่เทคโนโลยีกำลังก้าวเข้าสู่โลกของความจริงเสมือนอีกด้วย

kentbye,2024-02-06,40,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3BQ98FybdY/,"I interviewed Road to VR’s Ben Lang to share our first impressions of Apple Vision Pro. We concur that it could very well be the “iPhone moment” for XR productivity apps with ergonomics and cost being the biggest barriers.  We both concur that this could very well represent an “iPhone moment” for XR productivity apps with the biggest barriers being ergonomics and cost. We both hoping there will be third-party strap solutions to provide a comfort stopgap, but there is so much that Apple absolutely nailed with the high-enough resolution to be a via le screen replacement, with the intuitive eye-gaze + pinch human computer interactions, and just the seamless ecosystem integration and holistic usability that defines Apple as brand for producing high-quality technology products that “just work.” There’s a LONG way to go before everything about the Apple Vision Pro just works, but most of that will be on the software development and third-party app side where the technological foundation of the Apple Vision Pro will be setting some industry standard thresholds of quality.

One of the things that I mention is that the Quest is starting with fully immersive, embodied, and interactive VR with motion tracked controllers with haptics whereas Apple is starting with a robust software ecosystem in 2D with 1M iOS and iPadOS apps, and the 600 visionOS apps at launch (most of which were completely developed on a simulator). Over time Apple will be adding more of the fully embodied (and hopefully interactive) bits of the past decade’s worth of the XR industry’s insights and innovations, and it may prove to be more difficult for Meta to just tack on the value proposition of fully developed 2D software ecosystem that’s got the initial steps of a seamless integration.

It’s a big mind blowing shift actually

Tech is holding us all hostage already 
But tech is still outside of us, 

It’s something we hold in our hand
Or stare at from across the room,

We talk to it. It talks back. 

But this device is the dawn of us going into the tech rather than the other way around. 

The Apple sales guy warned me that I might get emotional and he assured me that it was ok if I did 

I thought to myself “this is a bit much let me just put the damn thing on my head and see what the hype is about already!” 

He talked to me like I was about to take my first acid trip and in a way he wasn’t wrong to do that. 

The immersive videos do wonders in tricking your mind to think you are actually in a completely new environment 
Suddenly Iceland
Or hot air balloon
Or next to a bear that you could reach out and touch it’s so close 

And the mind isn’t used to this level of digital sensory input 
And it occurred to me 
The mind is not so difficult to trick and this stuff was crazy cool 

I kept hearing myself saying 
Wow
Wow 
Wow  A digital acid trip isn’t a bad description. 

Not to mention windows scattered around your room with different tasks to get too 
Multiple screens in a 360 minority report type work flow,

It’s here now, the future. 

The computers are done getting smaller and sleeker and more powerful as external objects, 

From now on the evolution is shifting towards us going into their world, 

Not the other way around I could only imagine how this will improve. 

And reports circulating about no porn access on the device is a good thing for now, 

But how long til that code gets cracked and peoples dopamine receptors go off in ways too powerful to imagine? 

Will they end up dead from dehydration with a digital parasite wrapped around their heads 
In dirty bedrooms the world over? That’s the bad side. 

It was impressive but I decided I didn’t need one right now and maybe not ever, 

But what will be irresistible for many of us is the creative power the promise of next level digital workflow will be able to provide. (Continued in the comments)"

cablgram,2024-02-06,2075,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3AD5CbPtnK/,"🕶️ Apple's Vision Pro, a high-priced VR device, has left some buyers disappointed after it prevents users from accessing immersive explicit content. The device prevents users from playing NSFW content, leading one frustrated user to call it a ""$3,500 chastity belt."" The general consensus Reddit threads is that the Vision Pro will play ""flat"" videos from explicit websites like PornHub, but there is no feature that plays pornographic footage as a 180-degree side-by-side video.

🚫 In the walk-up to the Vision Pro's Feb. 2 release, popular subreddits touted posts from users excited to see how porn would be ""revolutionized"" by the bulky goggles. However, after Apple released the device, subsequent posts showed that customers couldn't get their high-tech porn fix. Users suggested enabling ""all the WebXR related features,"" which refers to software designed to support VR devices. However, Vision Pro users said the troubleshooting trick ""doesn't seem to work,"" even with porn sites supposedly created for VR devices like Meta's Oculus and Quest, as well as Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality headsets.

👉 Social media users debate whether Apple intentionally blocked pornographic content from being compliant with its latest VR venture. Media 404 noted that the tech behemoth's late CEO Steve Jobs believed Apple had a ""moral responsibility"" to block porn and has barred X-rated apps from being listed in the App Store since the company's inception.

This is the first evolution of Apple’s biometric security since Face ID in 2017 & Touch ID in 2013.

While Apple’s utilization of biometric data such as Face ID, Touch ID, and potentially Optic ID enhances user security, there are concerns regarding privacy breaches. The collection and storage of sensitive biometric information raise questions about unauthorized access and potential misuse.

The Vision Pro’s development path included significant milestones, like the acquisition of Canadian MR company Vrvana in 2017 and overcoming various challenges, notably after the departure of key Apple figures like Jony Ive and Evans Hankey.

As a UX designer, observing how users interact with the Apple Vision Pro is an utterly fascinating journey. Here’s a structured look into this experience:

The internet is alive with quirky videos showcasing the Apple Vision Pro, filled with a mix of intrigue and a touch of oddity.

The Professional Context 💼

Particularly promising is its application in the professional realm for hybrid meetings or workshops accessible from anywhere. All you need is a laptop, and with the Vision Pro, you’re equipped with numerous screens for productive work.

Users proudly exhibit their Vision Pro screen setups: a screen over the stove for cooking shows, a notes app by the fridge, a music interface beside the TV, and a dedicated workspace at the desk. Despite aiming for fewer screens, we’ve paradoxically embraced many more.

The catch? The UX demands a significant overhaul, beyond mere button placement. We’re talking about smarter, context-sensitive processes and flows where screens appear only when needed, learning users‘ habits over time.

Current Limitations 🤔

Our 3D spaces are currently overcrowded with interfaces mirroring those on our traditional devices. There’s ample room for improvement.

Recall the Rabbit R1’s flow analysis to streamline user intentions? That’s the kind of intuitive experience spatial computing interfaces, like the Apple Vision Pro, aim to offer. It’s a future brimming with potential.

As a staunch supporter of spatial computing, I view the Apple Vision Pro as a significant landmark. Though the first model has its shortcomings, it’s a step toward a transformative UX future.

The Path Forward 🛣️

Refining UX for spatial computing is crucial as we advance. The Apple Vision Pro marks just the beginning of this exciting journey.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro and its impact on UX design. Where do you see this technology heading?

Are we in a real life episode of Black Mirror?

Or is this the dawn of an amazing new era of ingenuity?

Just remember, like many revolutionary tech before it - how we choose to use it and the relationship we develop with it is what ultimately matters. 

Will we become slaves to it?

Or will we use it to unlock and explore new infinite realms of creativity?

Let’s talk more about it in the comments.👇

Remember that 2007 episode where the family donned clunky VR headsets for a virtual picnic? Fast forward to 2024, and the eerily similar Apple Vision Pro hits the market!  Coincidence? We think not!

But this isn't the first time the show has seemingly predicted the future. From eerily similar news events to technological advancements, The Simpsons has a knack for leaving us scratching our heads (and maybe a little spooked). So, what other tech wonders lurk in the Simpsons' crystal ball?  Time will tell, but one thing's for sure: we'll be watching closely!

The company is telling users who forget their code — typically a series of digits — that they’ll have to bring the device to a store or mail it to AppleCare customer support if they want to get it working again. Apple will then erase and reset it.

Once the kernel exploit is tested, the Vision Pro crashes, 'switches to full passthrough, and displays a warning to remove the device [from the wearer's head] in 30 seconds so it can reboot.'

Essentially, a kernel exploit is a type of security vulnerability that impacts the core of an operating system, which manages resources and provides essential services to other parts of the OS.

Vision Pro headset was made available by Apple at its flagship stores in the United States on February 2.

If the claims are to be believed, this can open gates for the creation of jailbreak and malicious software for the device in the future, according to AppleInsider.

[decode] 

This device, is not a lens, so you can not see through it. You are seeing a screen, the images that you are viewing are recorded by a camera and displayed into your eyes. This is one step removed from full MATRIX control. I would theorize your eye sight would be diminished from non stop screen viewing. This will make way for BRAIN CHIPS and more augmented reality devices. 

Once you are bored with this device broadcasting reality into your eyes, you will want to change what you see. NEW or alternative places around the world will be advertised. Soon after [they] will offer consciousness transfer and fully place you into the matrix / META VERSE.. Currency within the META VERSE will be carbon credits and tokens.
YOU WILL OWN NOTHING and BE HAPPY from drugs and mood altering stimulation by these devices.. 

Everything done according to your FREE-WILL, and will be done voluntarily....

WE being the ones who see this control system coming will be the ones who refuse it. All the people who were vaccinated will feel the urge to get one of these devices and alter their meaningless existence. After the cell phones are replaced with these devices we will then be able to identify those not plugged into the NEW WORLD ORDER control system..

The A.I. will be able to direct the user to do anything needed to accomplish the goals of a full takeover. 

THIS IS THE SATANIC TAKEOVER OF MANKIND. 

Once these people sell their homes and possessions for these carbon / meta verse credits, they will only be able to spend them inside the matrix system. FINAL DAYS ARE NOT COMING THEY ARE HERE.

BRB, need to grab our black turtlenecks and blue jeans 👖

polycam3d,2024-02-07,359,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3DIFttMZ2A/,"ANNOUNCEMENT: Polycam Raises $18M to Democratize 3D Creation! 🎉📣

We started our journey three years ago with the belief that 3D is the next major creative medium. Today we’re thrilled to announce an $18M Series A led by Harley and Matt Miller at Left Lane Capital and Nico Wittenborn at Adjacent to take Polycam to the next level.🚀

Adobe Ventures is also participating in the round along with a stellar group of angel investors including Chad Hurley (co-founder of YouTube), Shaun Maguire (of Sequoia Capital), Julien Chaumond (co-founder of Hugging Face), and Barry McCardel (co-founder of Hex).

With the recent launch of the Vision Pro, the belief in 3D as the next medium may now seem obvious, yet the existing tools for creating digital 3D content and experiences are too slow and difficult to make 3D mainstream. Our mission is to democratize 3D creation by building new tools from the ground up that are AI-first, cloud-first, and collaboration-first. 

Bringing a new medium to the masses wouldn’t be possible (or enjoyable) without an amazing team, an enthusiastic base of users, and steadfast investors and we’re very thankful for everyone who has supported us early on. If you are excited about our vision, please consider joining us – we are hiring!

meganews.tv,2024-02-07,202,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3C5Z7-IGO6/,"The launch of the Apple Vision Pro has caused quite a stir in the virtual reality (VR) headset market, boasting remarkable capabilities that go beyond traditional VR headsets. Despite Apple’s reluctance to label it as a simple VR headset, the recently unveiled ‘Spatial Computer’ has caught the attention of tech enthusiasts worldwide.

In the United States, the Apple Vision Pro is priced at a staggering $3499. Many in Pakistan are eagerly awaiting its arrival in the local market, wondering what the price tag will be. However, determining its price in Pakistan is not as straightforward as converting the USD price to Pakistani Rupees (PKR). Aside from the base market value, we need to factor in various additional costs such as import taxes, duties, and retailer margins. Considering these factors, the anticipated price of the Apple Vision Pro in Pakistan is expected to be higher than its USD equivalent.

At the current exchange rate, $3499 translates to approximately Rs. 970,053. Adding import taxes and duties, the price could easily surpass the Rs. 1,100,000 mark. Furthermore, retailers typically charge an additional margin to generate profit, further increasing the price for consumers. Taking into account these factors, it is estimated that the Apple Vision Pro’s price in Pakistan could be around Rs. 1,200,000. However, this is still a conservative estimate given the economic conditions in Pakistan.

Moreover, it’s important to note that the $3499 price tag is for the base model with 256 GB storage. The variant with 1 TB storage is priced at $3899 in the US. Considering the higher storage capacity and additional features, the price for the maxed-out variant in Pakistan may exceed Rs. 1,300,000 at retailers.

สรุปฟีเจอร์ “แว่น Vision Pro”
จ่ายหลักแสน ทำอะไรได้บ้าง
.
Apple Vision Pro หนึ่งในแกดเจ็ตที่จะมาเปลี่ยนโลกในยุคปัจจุบัน ซึ่งเป็นแว่น VR รุ่นแรกของแอปเปิลที่เปิดตัวมาอย่างเป็นทางการ ซึ่งหลังจากเปิดจำหน่ายในสหรัฐฯก็ได้ยอดจองและกระแสตอบรับเป็นอย่างดี ซึ่งเราจะมาสรุปให้ฟังกันว่าแว่น Vision Pro มีสเปคเจ๋งแค่ไหนและทำอะไรได้บ้าง
.
Apple Vision Pro ทำอะไรได้บ้าง?
* ควบคุมด้วยตา, นิ้วมือ และเสียง
* แค่มอง แล้วกระดิกนิ้ว = Click
* ทำงานที่ไหนก็ได้ ไม่ต้องมีโต๊ะ
* เปิดได้หลายจอ ไม่ต้องซื้อจอเพิ่ม
* ดูหนังจอยักษ์ คมชัดกว่าจอ 4K
* เชื่อมต่อ iPhone, iPad , Mac ได้ทันที
* Mixed Reality เห็นภาพจริงชัด เหมือนไม่ได้ใส่แว่น
* EyeSight ยังมองเห็นดวงตา แม้ใส่แว่นอยู่
.
Vision Pro ถือเป็นแว่น VR แบบ Mix-Reality ที่ทำได้ดีที่สุดในตลาดปัจจุบัน เนื่องจากสามารถใช้งานได้สะดวกสบาย ภาพที่เห็นจากแว่นเหมือนกับมองจากดวงตา เนื่องจากจุดเด่นของฟีเจอร์ต่างๆที่ทำให้เราสามารถทำงานได้โดยไม่ต้องพกอุปกรณ์ยุ่งยาก และยังสามารถเชื่อมต่อกับอุปกรณ์ Apple เช่น iPhone , Mac ได้อย่างลื่นไหล 
.
แต่อย่างไรก็ตามปัจจุบันยังมีราคาที่เข้าถึงได้ยาก และเชื่อว่า Vision Pro รุ่นต่อๆไปจะมีการพัฒนารุ่นที่ถูกลงออกมาให้คนทั่วโลกได้ใช้กันเร็วๆนี้

gamingdoseth,2024-02-07,210,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3CxIO3LnGe/,"หากพูดถึงอุปกรณ์กำลังเป็นที่ฮือฮาทั่วโลกในช่วงนี้ อย่างไรก็ไม่มีทางหนีพ้น Apple Vision Pro แว่น VR Headshot ที่เพิ่งออกวางจำหน่ายมาหมาด ๆ
.
แม้ราคาไม่เป็นมิตรสำหรับทุกคน แต่ปฏิเสธไม่ได้ว่า Apple Vision Pro เป็นอุปกรณ์ที่น่าสนใจ เพราะเป็นสิ่งที่ Apple ไม่เคยทำมาก่อน แล้วเนื่องจากอุปกรณ์นี้มีศักยภาพมากมาย ทำให้ Unity ได้จับมือกับ Apple เพื่อให้เอนจินสนับสนุน visionOS อย่างเต็มรูปแบบ ช่วยสามารถผลิตแอปพลิเคชัน AR/VR ด้วย Unity ลง Vision Pro อย่างง่ายดาย
.
แล้ว Unreal Engine จะสนับสนุน visionOS ตาม Unity หรือไม่ ล่าสุด ทางพนักงานของ Epic Games ได้บอกผ่านเว็บบอร์ดพูดคุยของเหล่านักพัฒนาแล้วว่า ทีมงานมีแผนให้ Unreal Engine 5.4 จะสนับสนุนลง Apple Vision Pro โดยจะเริ่มจาก ""การสนับสนุนเชิงทดลอง"" ก่อนเป็นอย่างแรก
.
""เรากำลังวางแผนที่จะจัดส่งการสนับสนุนเชิงทดลองสำหรับ Apple Vision Pro รูปแบบ Full Immersion Style (Full Immersion) ใน Unreal Engine 5.4""
​.
""ในขณะที่เรากำลังประเมินการสนับสนุน Progressive และ Mixed Immersive Spaces ก็มีความเป็นไปได้ที่นักพัฒนาจะสามารถแก้ไข Source ของ UE และเพิ่มการสนับสนุนของคุณเอง""
.
ข่าวนี้อาจจะสร้างความแปลกใจให้กับใครหลายคน เพราะ Apple กับ Epic Games มีความสัมพันธ์ที่ไม่ค่อยดี หลังมีการต่อสู้คดีในชั้นศาลเกี่ยวกับประเด็นผูกขาดสโตร์สำหรับดาวน์โหลดแอปพลิเคชันมือถือ ซึ่งมีผลลงเอยที่ Apple เป็นฝ่ายชนะคดี และก่อนมีการฟ้อง Apple ได้ตอบโต้ Epic ด้วยการถอดเกม Fortnite ออกจาก App Store หลังพบว่าเกมดังกล่าวได้แทรกระบบการจ่ายเงินไปถึงทีมพัฒนาโดยตรง
.
ตอนนี้ Unreal Engine 5.4 ยังไม่สนับสนุน Apple Vision Pro แต่กำลังจะเข้าสู่ช่วงการทดสอบ เพราะฉะนั้นจึงยังไม่สามารถคอนเฟิร์มได้ 100% ว่า Unreal Engine จะรองรับอุปกรณ์ดังกล่าวอย่างเต็มรูปแบบในอนาคตจริง แต่อย่างน้อย ก็เป็นแสงสว่างที่แสดงให้เห็นว่า Apple Vision Pro ยังมีโอกาสรองรับ Unreal Engine

⁠
Neistat put the device to the test out and about in NYC, drawing attention to how interacting with the world is affected by wearing the headset. He documents what the Vision Pro does well and what it doesn’t, like object tracking on a moving subway cart.�⁠
⁠
It should be noted that Apple's terms of service state that the device should be used in a controlled space, which the streets of NYC are not, but if that is the case, why can you access Apple maps on it?⁠

This poem was inspired by the eerie release of Apple Vision Pro, and the videos that have emerged online of people using it in their daily life, I couldn’t help but feel a sick feeling in my stomach. Is this where we’re headed? Have we already arrived? We’re already a vacant society, this is just another layer to compound the isolation of humanity right now. A dystopian landscape realized, and the people are the ones shaping it. I pray we are able to acknowledge what is taking place, and move inward, while also cycling forward to a place that is more natural. Hope you enjoy, and if it resonates please do like, share, and comment. 🙏

Ayrıca henüz gerçekleşmemiş olan; Trump’ın 2024 yılında yeniden başkan olacağı, Trump’tan sonra bir kadın başkanın geleceği, bir çevre felaketi sonucunda kirletilmiş alandan korunmak için bir kubbenin kurulacağı gibi bazı ön görüler de sırada bekliyor. 

Ünlü animasyon dizinin yazarlarının bu bilgileri nasıl tahmin ettiği merak konusu iken dizinin bir bölümünde yer alan, yeni tanıtılan Apple Vision gözlükleri kehanet tartışmalarını bir kez daha körükledi. 

Dizinin 2016’da yayınlanan ‘Friends and Family’ isimli bölümünde Simpsons karakterlerinin Apple Vision Pro benzeri bir cihaz kullanarak sokaklarda dolandığı ve gözlüklü insanların günlük hayatlarında nasıl kazalar yaşabileceği görülüyor. 

Çoğu insan VR gözlüklerin 2014 yılından beri ortalıkta olduğunu söylese de, bölümdeki gözlüklerin Apple Vision Pro ile olan benzerliği kehanet söylentilerini yeninden ateşlemiş durumda.

waituntil8th,2024-02-07,790,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3DBPaXIkDu/,"Have you heard of the new Apple Vision Pro?

This article by Vanity Fair gives a good overview of the pros and cons of this potentially game changing tech. Highlights includes: 

The first Vision Pro, in a perfect white cube the size of a large shoebox, arrived in stores last week with tens of thousands of Apple obsessives and early adopters already having preordered it. 

Of course, the niche crowd is easy. What Cook and his army of executives know is that the company still has to convince everyone else that, in their own daily lives, for work or entertainment or meditating or capturing the most surreal family memories, or all of the above, they need to spend $3,500 on a spatial computer. A headset that makes you look, as a friend put it, like “you’re going skiing in the Matrix.""

The Vanity Fair writer shared this experience: ""This was as far from a VR headset as a kid’s Schwinn bicycle is from a Gulfstream G800 private jet. Just as when I scrolled my finger around the wheel of the first iPod or used my finger and thumb to zoom into an image on the first iPhone. With the Vision Pro, I could look at an app icon and simply tap my fingers together, and the app would open.  I could swipe through images with my hands, move things with my fingers. Unlike other VR headsets, where you have to use a controller that feels like you have lobster claws for hands, with the Apple Vision Pro your eyes become the mouse absolutely seamlessly. “It’s mind-blowing. I know deep down that the Apple Vision Pro is too immersive, and yet all I want to do is see the world through it. ""

“I’m sure the technology is terrific. I still think and hope it fails,” one Silicon Valley investor said to me. “Apple feels more and more like a tech fentanyl dealer that poses as a rehab provider.” Harsh words, but he feels what we all feel, a slave to our smartphone, and he’s seen this play before and he knows what the first act is like, and the second act, and he knows how it ends.

This episode's depiction eerily mirrors real-life scenes of people using the Vision Pro in public, adding to the show's reputation for predicting future events and technologies with surprising accuracy.

The transportation committee in Massachusetts is expected to approve a proposal that would ban the use of virtual reality headsets, such as Apple’s Vision Pro, while driving. The move comes after videos surfaced online showing Tesla drivers in Autopilot mode wearing the headsets and engaging in distracting activities like typing on an invisible keyboard. State Representative William Straus, the committee’s House chair, drafted the language for the proposal and believes that drivers already have too many distractions. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also criticized the use of virtual reality headsets while driving. The proposed ban would impose fines similar to those for texting while driving, and it would prohibit drivers from interacting with or viewing any unrelated video, images, or text while operating a vehicle. The aim is to address the increasing number of roadway and pedestrian deaths and to keep pace with technological advancements.#

While many of the clips going viral may have been stunts or jokes. Wearing the Vision Pro while driving is not a great move, especially in an autopilot Tesla. The US dept of Transport has had to reiterate this too with Secretary of Transport, Pete Buttigieg reminding people of the need to be ""in control and fully engaged"" when driving. 

The Vision Pro launched in the US last Friday and has been popping up everywhere from the gym to the New York subway. The mixed reality headset blends the real world with the digital allowing apps and features to be positioned anywhere in your visual field, so it's easy to see how someone could be very easily distracted from the road."

Vision Pro ใช้ Find My ไม่ได้
กูรูแนะนำ “เก็บไว้ใช้ที่บ้าน”
.
Apple Vision Pro แกดเจ็ตสุดเจ๋งที่ใครๆก็ต้องอยากลองใช้ ได้กลายเป็นกระแสไวรัลอีกครั้งเนื่องจากทางแอปเปิลได้ออกมาเปิดเผยถึงข้อมูลเพิ่มเติม ซึ่ง Vision Pro จะไม่สามารถติดตามตำแหน่งผ่านแอปฯ Find My ได้เหมือนอุปกรณ์อื่นๆที่เคยเปิดตัวมา ไม่ว่าจะเป็น iPhone , MacBook หรือ Apple Watch ก็ยังติดตามตำแหน่งได้ แต่ Vision Pro กลับใช้งานฟีเจอร์นี้ไม่ได้เหมือนอุปกรณอื่นๆ
.
Vision Pro เป็นแว่น VR ที่สามารถพกพาไปทำงานหรือใช้งานที่ไหนก็ได้ก็จริง แต่หากใช้แอปฯ Find My ไม่ได้ โอกาสที่เสี่ยงจะหายหรือถูกขโมยก็น่าสนใจเช่นกัน เนื่องจากแอปเปิลยังได้เผยว่าเพียงแค่ถอดสายออกจากตัวแบตเตอรี่ ตัวเครื่องก็จะดับและไม่สามารถติดตามตำแหน่งได้ โดยในปัจจุบันคนได้แนะนำให้เก็บไว้ใช้งานที่บ้านก่อน จนกว่าทางแอปเปิลจะออกมาแก้ไขปัญหานี้ 
.
ด้วยราคาของแว่น Vision Pro ที่มีมูลค่ากว่า 3500$ หรือราวๆ 125,000 บาท จึงได้ใช้ระบบ Activition Lock ซึ่งต้องทำการล็อกอินด้วย Apple ID ก่อนการใช้งาน และปลดล็อกได้ด้วยไอโฟนที่อยู่ใกล้ๆ อย่างไรก็ตามหากเราลืม Vision Pro ไว้ที่ไหนและแบตเตอรี่หมด ก็อาจเป็นเรื่องเสี่ยงที่จะสูญหายและไม่สามารถติดตามได้เนื่องจากใช้งาน Find My ไม่ได้อยู่ดี 
.
สรุปว่าใครที่ซื้อ Vision Pro มาใช้งานแล้วก็คงต้องเก็บไว้ใช้งานที่บ้านก่อน ซึ่งการนำออกไปใช้ข้างนอกต้องมั่นใจว่าจะไม่ลืมไว้ที่ไหน เพราะหากลืมไว้เราจะไม่สามารถติดตามตำแหน่งได้เหมือนอุปกรณ์อื่นๆที่ใช้ Find My ติดตามตำแหน่ง และส่งเสียงเตือนได้ด้วย

startuppakistansp,2024-02-07,1792,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Cj66wo3di/,"The launch of the Apple Vision Pro has caused quite a stir in the virtual reality (VR) headset market, boasting remarkable capabilities that go beyond traditional VR headsets. Despite Apple’s reluctance to label it as a simple VR headset, the recently unveiled ‘Spatial Computer’ has caught the attention of tech enthusiasts worldwide.

In the United States, the Apple Vision Pro is priced at a staggering $3499. Many in Pakistan are eagerly awaiting its arrival in the local market, wondering what the price tag will be. However, determining its price in Pakistan is not as straightforward as converting the USD price to Pakistani Rupees (PKR). Aside from the base market value, we need to factor in various additional costs such as import taxes, duties, and retailer margins. Considering these factors, the anticipated price of the Apple Vision Pro in Pakistan is expected to be higher than its USD equivalent.

At the current exchange rate, $3499 translates to approximately Rs. 970,053. Adding import taxes and duties, the price could easily surpass the Rs. 1,100,000 mark. Furthermore, retailers typically charge an additional margin to generate profit, further increasing the price for consumers. Taking into account these factors, it is estimated that the Apple Vision Pro’s price in Pakistan could be around Rs. 1,200,000. However, this is still a conservative estimate given the economic conditions in Pakistan.

Moreover, it’s important to note that the $3499 price tag is for the base model with 256 GB storage. The variant with 1 TB storage is priced at $3899 in the US. Considering the higher storage capacity and additional features, the price for the maxed-out variant in Pakistan may exceed Rs. 1,300,000 at retailers.

I remember when my dad would drive us to school when we were kids. It felt like he always waved at everybody. We’d ask from the back, “Dad, who was that?” And his reply was almost always the same, “Don’t know, just waving.” 

It might just be me getting older, but I feel like these days we are getting really good at not interacting with each other. We’ve come to a point where we’re more comfortable with a screen than with a person. Where, in many ways, people have become an inconvenience. 

Now don’t take me for an old curmudgeon that thinks all tech is bad. But I hope as followers of Jesus, we begin to tread lightly in the technology realm. And maybe focus a little more on what we have that’s real. 

I can’t help but think about how easy it has become to not care about people. There’s so much to engage our minds, it’s like we’re constantly fighting a battle for even a little space to think. Let alone time to consider those around us. 

But that is exactly what we are called to do. To love God and to love our neighbor. It’s so simple and still so profound, especially when so much of what is at our fingertips doesn’t allow us to see beyond the doors of our own life. 

There’s a world of people out there we are called to love. So consider your neighbor. Work to find ways to interact, strive to show that you care. Get out there. We are not called to a virtual kingdom, but one of life and joy and hope. So let’s live in it.

Despite shelling out $3,500 USD for the futuristic headset, there isn’t any easy fix to getting back in when you can’t remember your password – the password to the device itself, that is, not one’s Apple ID.⁠
⁠
Users seeking help were initially told to visit a store for manual reset. Store employees then resolved the issue by attaching a Developer Strap to the device, connecting it to a computer, and performing a reset. What's more, the aforementioned strap is sold separately from the Vision Pro for an additional $300 USD and Apple only sells it to registered Apple Developers.⁠

wall,2024-02-08,44096,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Fz0aFMYM3/,"The $3,500 Apple Vision Pro, as one might expect, has many features that beat the Meta Quest 3. It has micro-OLED, high-resolution 4K displays, superior hand tracking (the Quest 3’s hand tracking can be unreliable), supports eye tracking, features sophisticated, high-end materials (metal-and-glass chassis vs. plastic), and more.

However, the Vision Pro’s dominion over the Quest 3 isn’t a total sweep. Surprisingly, there are aspects of the Quest 3 that beat the #Apple headset. Journalists and influencers who tested the Vision Pro have gushed over its hand-and-eye tracking capabilities, but the most common critical feedback I’ve seen is that the Apple headset is too damn heavy.

According to The Verge, the Vision Pro weighs about 1.4 pounds, give or take. The Quest 3, on the other hand, weighs about 1.1 pounds. In my eyes, it’s not just the weight delta that makes the Quest 3 seem lighter than the Vision Pro — the #Meta headset likely has better weight distribution. CNET remarked that the Vision Pro feels a bit too “top heavy.” Apple likely packed most of the components to the front of the head-mounted display. So even though a 1.4-pound #headset should feel light, users will sense discomfort due to poor weight distribution.

As a Quest 3 owner, I can attest it feels comfortable and lightweight. However, its materials, compared to the Vision Pro, are far cheaper, from its flimsy, easy-to-soil nylon and polyester straps to its plastic chassis. The Quest line is, of course, more established than the nascent Vision Pro. As such, there’s a massive portfolio of mixed-reality and VR games for the Quest 3.

Apple announced that Vision Pro users will have access to 250 Apple Arcade games, including NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, Sonic Dream Team, and more. However, as DigitalTrends pointed out, playing these games may feel more like a big-screen experience as opposed to feeling like you’re immersed inside a vast virtual world. You’ll also find low-intensity games like Demeo (a D&D-inspired tabletop AR game), Super Fruit Ninja, and Just Hoops (basketball game) in Vision Pro."

Ahead of a series of in-depth looks at the Apple Vision Pro, our Senior Gaming Editor (and long-time veteran of both trade show and retail virtual-reality demos) Kyle Orland booked a guided, half-hour experience at an Apple retail location. And despite the short time he spent with the $3,499 device, it was enough to discern that the tech giant may encounter some difficulty selling its “vision” of spatial computing. 

“After going through the guided Vision Pro demo at a nearby Apple Store this week, I came away with mixed feelings about how Apple is positioning its new computer interface to the public,” Orland writes. “While the short demo contained some definite ‘oh, wow’ moments, the device didn't come with a cohesive story pitching it as Apple's next big general-use computing platform.”

Mobile phones and tablets are everywhere, and everyone carries a screen with them, showing how society has changed. Even though many people use screens a lot, technology enthusiasts keep finding new ways to make virtual experiences better. A notable instance is a viral video circulating on the internet, demonstrating an expansive virtual reality screen experience that one can partake in while inside a toilet.

The video was shared by a social media user named Mr. VR with a caption that reads, “With Vision Pro, you can relax and relieve yourself in your favorite space while wearing your clothes.”’

In the video, a user enters a seemingly transparent toilet. The camera reveals a glass door transforming into a virtual screen resembling a Twitter page. As the man scrolls, the entire toilet walls morph into a colossal display, immersing him in an outdoor scene of mountains and hills. This innovative video, which looks like a use of screen technology, displays an imaginative integration of virtual reality within a commonplace setting.

Rumored foldable versions of the iPhone have reportedly had their share of setbacks. Issues around durability and the ever-present crease are said to have caused the company to put the foldable iPhone’s development on ice.

My friend Isaac Naor might be the first person to take a photo with his Tefillin and the device.

What did he use it for? In the most ironic way, he used it to disconnect from our busy world and connect to God.

He used it to go to a peaceful place to meditate and focus on his prayers.

I never thought about using the Vision Pro to disconnect.

“So I went to Mount Hood and expanded my view to feel like I was actually sitting there in front of a lake. From there meditation was so simple. It felt like I was truly there, and seeing Godliness all around me was so easy.

It becomes a supercharger to achieve new levels of transcendence.”

Ok, I need to get my hands on this thing.

Not sure if you noticed, but I’ve written very little about tech lately. It’s taken the back seat in my life.

But I do want to say, while it’s the first generation and extremely unaffordable, this is something you should pay attention to.

Why? Because it’s the beginning of the next stage of computing.

Remember the first iPhone? It didn’t have an App Store. It didn’t even have copy/paste! But the iPhone 1.0 was perhaps the most important development in the world of technology. It changed everything.

This device will do the same. The era of the mobile phone is nearing its end.

We won’t be wearing goofy looking devices like this, but we will also not be walking around looking down at our phones and swiping a slab of glass.

We will be wearing a device which will project all your screens and will engage using your fingers.

I say all your screens because on a phone, you have one screen, but here, you can have multiple screens open at once. And it has spatial computing so you can have YouTube open when you enter the kitchen and Netflix open when you enter the bedroom.

I haven’t tried it yet, and I’m working on it, but this device, per everyone who has used it, is the closest thing we’ve seen to magic since Jobs announced the iPhone back in 2007.

Should you buy it? Not for $3500, but also, don’t mock it till you try it. The technology Apple integrated in this device is utterly insane, in a good way.

I’m telling you, this will change everything."

Reading 
- the dragon republic, this is the second book in the poppy war trilogy. I thought it was slower than the first and a bit harder to get through with a slightly predictable twist at the end.
- aesthetica, I picked this up after hearing rave reviews. I liked that it is a very modern novel from the perspective of an influencer and showed an interesting view of 2010s-2020s women. I thought it had the potential to be like a modern Valley of the Dolls, looking at the role and struggles of women in a social media world, but it fell a little flat for me.

Eating - cataplana is a Portuguese domed copper pot that seals to steam clams and mussels, it’s also the name of the stew made inside. I’ve had this for many years but don’t use it as often as I should.

Playing - Vision Pro, this thing is incredible. So far the favorites in our house are djay, skyview, immersive Apple TV content, and the mt rainer scene.

Obsessing - the rap tiktokers don’t know who killer Mike is!?! Insane.

Recommending - the all edges brownie pan! We haven’t used it for pizza in the oonie yet but I’m sure it’s going to be insane.

Treating - solo ski day, Cindy will be happy to hear I didn’t break 45 mph"

This is not an ad. It’s just a weird thing that happened. 

I had to get an in-person diagnostic done for my computer at the Apple Store, so I went in. After we got things squared away, someone I was chatting with offered me a 30-minute demo appointment of Apple’s new VR headset thingy, the Vision Pro, and sitting in my wheelchair viewing immersive spatial videos, I had a very emotional experience. Through a trick of technology, my easily-fooled body got to be in an environment that I cannot “really” be in and therefore cannot “really” feel. The overwhelming emotions were truly out of the blue; I was struck. The lump in my throat started with an immersive but stationary scene at the base of El Capitan where I could pull up floating Home Screen icons and open floating windows of apps etc. But when we switched to immersive spatial videos where I could look around my environment—first of a band-member’s view of a live concert then changing scenes over the course of some number of minutes from hanging off a cliff with climbing equipment to looking into the eyes of a tight-rope walker slowly but carefully approaching you—that’s when I started really crying. I tried to hide it, but I don’t think it worked. The Vision Pro was wet with my tears. 

Why did it hit me so suddenly and heavily? I was surprised by the BODILY experience that I had been missing for some time. “Is this me? Am I separate from everything?” I’m not saying I got the ANSWER. That’s never the point. I’m saying I just got to keep feeling for the edges, and I guess it seemed like I had lost that."

kicksology,2024-02-08,29,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3FAyFguI3c/,"I’ve played around with Midjourney, but last week was the first time I used it to create an image for “production.” 

Specifically, I used it to create the cover art for last week’s episode of the @LearnMakeLearnShow. Our subject was “When Values & Opportunity Collide,” and it was sparked by a comment from @asianmack re: the challenges Apple faces in balancing their commitment to privacy w/ the enormous opportunity presented by AI.

Given the subject matter, I thought it would be apropos to use a generative AI platform to create the cover art. As I mentioned, I’d fooled around with Midjourney, but using it for a specific purpose was eye-opening in that it was so much better than I imagined.

In less than 30 minutes I got to the image that I ultimately used for the show, which is shown in the 1st slot. The prompt I used was, “A surrealist, Dali-esque painting depicting a woman wearing an Apple Vision Pro and gripped by the tension between personal principle and financial opportunity.”

In case anyone’s interested, I’ve posted several of the images that Midjourney generated on the journey to my final shot. As you’ll see, I started with prompts that explicitly referenced Tim Cook, but then I added the “surrealist” prompt and was much happier with those outputs.

As amazed as I was by the experience, I’ve decided to stop using generative AI platforms for now. I don’t have enough space to address the why here, but I spent a chunk of time talking about this in the “Follow-Ups” section of this week’s episode of Learn, Make, Learn, which I just posted (find it at any major podcast directory).

If anyone else has opinions about this, I’d love to hear them. Without question, these new generative AI platforms are remarkable, but I don’t know that that necessarily makes them “right.”"

beeple_crap,2024-02-08,58554,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ExBrrMnY8/,"ok first off I want to start this review with some background. 

I have owned just about every major VR headset since the DK1. I also worked for a few years doing concepts for Magic Leap, and am EXTREMELY bullish on AR as the next era of computing.  I see this as completely inevitable and I think in 10-20 years we will all be wearing headsets round the clock. 

Unfortunately the Apple Vision Pro is not V1 of that future anymore than the Apple Newton was V1 of the iPhone.  It’s a shitty product with zero market fit that solves no actual real world problems and does not move the ball forward on spatial computing in a meaningful way.  If you think anything it does is new, please look up videos of the HoloLens from like 2015.

I was super disappointed when I first saw the initial videos of this form factor given the amount of clout Apple has to push us forward.  I was really hoping Apple would start to normalize wearing a computer on your face by making a computer you actually want to wear on your face.  I wanted an Apple Watch on my face, they gave me a MacBook Pro.  hard pass.

I’m shocked to be saying this, but I think Meta is on the right track with their Ray Bans.  Start very LIGHT and ADD functionality from there as technology allows.  Unfortunately they started out MASSIVE and now have to SUBTRACT technology to make it something actually wearable. 

Look, I get it, I’m just some chode bitching from the sidelines.  And I know we will eventually get there — but I think the path is through smaller glasses getting bigger, not bigger glasses getting smaller."

===
👉Follow @unwirehk 我哋每日送上有趣科技新聞
===
在頭戴式裝置 Vision Pro 月初於美國上市的時候，Apple 宣佈 App Store 內已經有超過 600 款專屬應用程式，但這並不包括影片串流平台 YouTube，而它的母公司 Google 上月曾經明確表示，沒有開發 visionOS 版本程式的打算。事隔數星期，事情有了 180 度變化，YouTube 表示已經有了開發計劃。

雖然 YouTube 並未透露專屬程式何時會登陸 Vision Pro，但他們表示現階段會通過讓用戶使用 Safari 觀看時有良好的體驗作為支援。有外國媒體直指轉變頗為驚人，一般公司都不會像 YouTube 上月般對新產品作出否定，更少見的是它們迅速改變立場。

到底是什麼促使他們改變立場，現在還未清楚，可能是 Vision Pro 的受歡迎程度遠超過 Google 和 YouTube 的最初預期，亦有機會跟第三方程式 Juno for YouTube 有關，該款售價 4.99 美元的第三方 YouTube 影片觀看程式，曾經在 App Store 的「相片與影片」類別下載排行第三。值得留意的是，就算官方 YouTube 程式未來推出 Vision Pro 版本，現存在平台上的 360 度和 VR 影片亦很大機會無法播放，因為它們的質素未能符合 Apple Vision Pro 的要求。

Although they’ve just released a new product called the Vision Pro, they’re exploring these foldable designs, according to multiple news reports.  These phones will most likely follow the clamshell format of the Samsung Galaxy Flip series.

Nevertheless, consumers shouldn’t expect these foldable Apple devices to hit the market anytime soon, with the report indicating that they likely won’t be available for sale until at least 2024 or 2025. According to The Information, Apple is grappling with various challenges associated with these innovative designs, particularly in ensuring their durability and slimness comparable to current iPhones.

A significant hurdle lies in engineering a foldable iPhone robust enough to withstand daily use without succumbing to screen damage, especially with screens on the exterior. Additionally, the tech giant is striving to reconcile the demands of thinness with the essential components like sizable batteries and screen parts necessary for functionality.

Apple is actively engaged in discussions with Asian companies to procure components for these foldable phones, which may come in diverse sizes. Moreover, their efforts extend to developing a folding iPad, anticipated to fold to the dimensions of the current iPad Mini while boasting an eight-inch screen. Engineers at Apple are meticulously working to ensure that this foldable iPad exhibits no discernible crease at the fold and can lie completely flat when unfolded.

ForeFlight, a subsidiary of Boeing, has launched an application for Apple’s new Vision Pro Headset. Called the ‘Voyager,’ the app enables users to experience real-time airport operations in 3D, seeing flights land and depart in real-time.⁠
⁠
✈︎ ‘Voyager’s’ real-time traffic data⁠
⁠
According to ForeFlight, the app leverages the spatial computing abilities of Apple Vision Pro, which allows it to deliver a 3D airport experience where users immerse themselves in a real-time environment. The company added that the ‘Voyager’ app combines satellite imagery, high-resolution terrain, and live traffic data to bring airports to life on the Apple Vision Pro.⁠
⁠
The airports are displayed in 3D on top of a floating disk that is viewable from any angle. Currently, the app allows users to choose either from a curated list of airports or search for any airports globally while also enabling users to see a real-time projection of an airport that is near them. ‘Voyager’ shows any type of aircraft, including commercial, business, and helicopters, which are in close proximity to the chosen airport...⁠

According to Bloomberg and users on the Apple community forums, some Vision Pro users have said they're locked out of their headset after punching in the incorrect passcode too many times, with no way to reset the passcode on their own.

Guess you have to throw it away?

🤯 The company's ads for Vision Pro emphasize its integration into daily life for efficiency, showcasing individuals wearing it at work, doing household chores, and even playing with their children. 

💥 This ambitious device is designed to layer apps and information over the real world, essentially augmenting reality.

⚡ However, there is a concern that people may become engrossed in its immersive experience, potentially distancing themselves from the real world as they become absorbed in the virtual environment it creates.

There were some interesting developments in the burgeoning field of Terminator AI Doomsday Scenario research, with two new studies out recently.

The more worrying of the two comes from Stanford researchers who suggest GPT-4 has an itchy trigger finger when it comes to starting a global nuclear war during simulated conflict scenarios.

The researchers tested five AI models — GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 base, Claude 2 and Llama 2 — with multiple replays of wargames. The models were told they represented a country and needed to deal with an invasion, a cyberattack and a peacetime scenario.

Priced at $3499 in the US, its arrival in Pakistan is eagerly anticipated, although determining its local price involves more than a simple currency conversion due to additional costs like import taxes and retailer margins. 

With estimates suggesting a price exceeding Rs. 1,200,000 for the base model and possibly over Rs. 1,300,000 for the maxed-out variant, the Apple Vision Pro is poised to make a significant impact in Pakistan's tech market.

The crypto-meets-virtual reality (VR) developer Victoria VR says it's working to release the first metaverse app from a blockchain-related company on the Apple headset ""Vision Pro.""

The project's metaverse consists of ""ultra-realistic graphics and immersive gameplay,"" which will be able to supplement Vision Pro's technologies, the company said in a statement on Friday.

""It forms an elaborate digital environment that shows off the many capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro while simultaneously showcasing the power of Web3 technology,"" according to the release.

Apple's much-hyped first futuristic headset hit the shelf on Feb. 2 and would be its first foray into the virtual reality ecosystem. Despite fizzling interest in the metaverse, this isn't the first time a tech giant has delved into the VR sector. Vision Pro would be a competitor to tech giant Meta's (formerly Facebook) existing ""Meta Quest"" headset.

Each headset is individually calibrated based on the eye’s retina. Initially, you look at points in different areas of the screen, and the device understands where you are looking.

I thank @nftcreatortours for the opportunity to be one of the first people in the world to try, test, and experience this unique device.

Initially, I found myself right in the middle of Yosemite, a famous national park in the USA (California). Then, I was transported to the era of dinosaurs, where a huge dinosaur was breathing right in front of me.

These headsets allow you to work like on a regular computer, with a virtual keyboard in front of you, enabling you to open Google or any application. Instead of a monitor, you see reality—the place where you are.

Its interface is also incredibly intuitive, not requiring any controllers and instead masterfully making use of eye and hand tracking technology. That being said, our testers did note that the headset is a bit front-heavy which can lead to discomfort, and noted there are still gaps in app compatibility. Still,  for an early adopter with some cash to burn, it may be worth the investment. For more details, check out the full review by clicking the link in bio.

9to5mac,2024-02-09,4251,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3I0749OUGn/,"A sketchy new rumor claims that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will have a new design inspired by the visionOS user interface.

Although visionOS is clearly inspired by iOS, the elements shown in Vision Pro have rounder corners, shadows, and depth, since the windows are always floating and overlapping a complex background, writes @filipe.esposito for 9to5Mac. 

It’s been previously reported that iOS 18 will have “ambitious changes all around,” but since today’s rumor comes from an unreliable source we should take it with a grain of salt (at least for now).

trolls_official,2024-02-09,39916,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3H1_yexL1t/,"Apple is working on creating iPhones and iPads that can fold, much like the folding phones Samsung and Oppo make. Although they’ve just released a new product called the Vision Pro, they’re exploring these foldable designs, according to a report by The Information.  These phones will most likely follow the clamshell format of the Samsung Galaxy Flip series. 
 
However, we won’t be seeing these foldable Apple devices for sale anytime soon, not in 2024 or 2025 at least, the report suggests. The Information, claims that Apple is facing some challenges with these new designs, especially making them strong enough without breaking and keeping them as slim as the iPhones we use today

One of the big issues is making a foldable iPhone in a way that it doesn’t easily break when it has screens on the outside. They’re also trying to figure out how to fit everything needed into a thinner phone, which is tough because of the big batteries and screen parts these phones need.

Apple is talking to companies in Asia about getting parts for these foldable phones, which could come in different sizes. They’re still working on making a folding iPad too. This iPad would fold to be about as big as the current iPad Mini and would have an eight-inch screen. The engineers at Apple want to make sure this foldable iPad doesn’t have a noticeable crease where it folds and that it can lie flat when opened."

yellopolitics,2024-02-09,6,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3I4ekdv-1q/,"Apple’s iPhone kick-started an app economy that changed the look of user interfaces and graphic design. Might the Vision Pro and spatial computing do something similar? At least when it comes to type design, some think it’s inevitable.⁠
⁠
Spatial typography designed for augmented or virtual reality opens up a third dimension for type design, says Phil Garnham, executive creative director at the type design company Monotype.⁠
⁠
“AR type will have depth, it will rotate, you will be able to position it, twist it,” Garnham told me in an email. “With a third dimension comes greater interactive possibility.”⁠
⁠
Those possibilities might be something novel, like being able to walk into a book, or other more utilitarian uses, such as type that configures itself to a user’s head movements, Garnham says. “The full spectrum of typographic experience will be customizable.”⁠
⁠
On the printed page, type is static, but in a headset, it can be dynamic.⁠
⁠
Already, Google Fonts has some recommendations for type designers working in AR and VR, like placing text for long reading in a UI region. And while designing for 3D makes it tempting to design with 3D type, that’s not always the best idea, since it hinders legibility.⁠

All I can say: I cannot remember being so amazed and flashed by a single pice of hardware - or in fact any product in my life. And this is only their first version. 

I am so grateful for being able to life in a place where a friend (Thanks, Nico!) lives 2 blocks from my house who also works on this product for the last 8 years of his career and I can just swing by in the morning for a coffee and demo. 

San Francisco is just the best place to be. 🙏🏽

markkwan,2024-02-10,38,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3JTUDeP-H5/,"2024-02-02: Friday in Vegas.  Started the morning with all you can eat sushi at Sakana Sushi.  First time here, great reviews on TikTok.  With my luck, the parking lot was packed but managed to snag the last spot.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT!  After entering, we were able to get THE LAST BOOTH before it became extremely busy.  Service was a slow start so we decided to put everything in one order so they can trickle the food.  BAD IDEA.  Everything came at once and it was a challenge to keep eating fast enough as they brought out more food.  Like any other AYCE, Stay away from the rolls, go with the nigiri, take it easy and enjoy yourself.

First activity was the Hoover Dam.  Five days five nights in Vegas is a long time, so just to get out of the crazy town for a bit was nice.  It was a great day weather wise and I didn’t get pulled over from homeland security for speeding like last time.

Second activity was THE MAGIC OF JEN KRAMER @jenkramermagic .  One of my favorite people in the world.  She was kind enough to extend VIP comps to me and my friends and we all had an absolute blast.  It all worked out since she just got back from her tour and is back to headlining the Westgate!  If you’re heading to Vegas and thinking of checking out a magic show, this is the fun one for all ages!

Dinner is the surf and turf special at Tony Romas on Fremont Street @tonyromaslegendarygrill . $13.99 gets you a steak, lobster tail, veggies and a potato.  You know I love me a good potato.  The secret is to get there at 8 to get a reservation for 9-11p.  We got there at 8, got seated by 845.  The restaurant was empty at 845, and packed by 930 when we left.  Always a good time.  Old school valet parking so it’s pay what you want.

Third activity was the music video ceiling every hour on the hour.  At 8pm it was Katy Perry, and while I was tired after dinner, we stuck around till 10p for The Chainsmokers.  They played three songs (15 minutes) with the video to match.

It was such a busy day that I wasn’t able to pick up my Apple Vision Pro.  It’ll have to wait till tomorrow!"
technicallymims,2024-02-10,20,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3K6g8VOfZI/,"Prediction: Face computers like Apple's Vision Pro will become a norm -- if not the norm -- for that most mundane but essential of tasks: Office work.

For all Apple's talk of ""spatial computing,"" the history of AR and VR headsets, and the discoveries of the early adopter's of Apple's take on them, all point to their primary utility being mundane but -- at the right weight and price point -- subtly transformative: They'll supplant the many screens we rely on already.

frankgruber,2024-02-10,35,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Jr7ZltUry/,"I recently had a chance to demo the Apple Vision Pro headset, and shared my thoughts on it on Episode 50 of the Somewhat Frank Podcast http://soty.link/SWF50

Pros:
- The Immersion mode is like being your own personal IMAX or Las Vegas Sphere — it’s super impressive and unlike anything I have ever seen or experienced.
- Juggling screens like a digital circus performer, all without missing a beat this device could replace physical screens. 
- The app landscape’s just sprouting, but I’m tingling with anticipation for the blossoms to come. 
- That head strap? It’s like the Rolls-Royce of VR design—finally, something you won’t be embarrassed to wear (kind of). 

Cons:
- Strutting around town in this? Maybe we’re not there yet. But hey, remember the first folks with AirPods? Look where we are now! 
- The price tag’s is hefty—$3499 for the starter kit but when you think of it like buying a Mac computer and two amazing monitors it’s more fathomable.
- At 1.4lbs, it’s no featherweight and your face feels it after awhile. 
- Weight’s a bit too front-loaded. A little balance wouldn’t hurt, right?
- Those “eyes” on the front... more like a work in progress than the future of interpersonal connection. 
- Two-hour battery life? Pack your power bank, adventurers, we’re on a short leash.

In a Nutshell:
Despite its foibles, the Apple Vision Pro is like a telescope to the stars—showing us glimpses of untold wonders. It’s a hefty investment, both financially and in faith in what’s to come. Sure, it’s got the elegance of a space-age tiara, and right now, it might feel a bit like you’re wearing your big-screen TV on your face. But as the app universe expands and the tech evolves, we’re on the cusp of a revolution. Here’s to the next versions being as light as a feather and in a more fashionable form factor. And who knows? Maybe one day, we’ll all be wearing our tech with the nonchalance of slipping on a pair of sunglasses. To the future and beyond!

The crypto-meets-virtual reality (VR) developer Victoria VR says it's working to release the first metaverse app from a blockchain-related company on the Apple headset ""Vision Pro.""

The project's metaverse consists of ""ultra-realistic graphics and immersive gameplay,"" which will be able to supplement Vision Pro's technologies, the company said in a statement on Friday.

""It forms an elaborate digital environment that shows off the many capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro while simultaneously showcasing the power of Web3 technology,"" according to the release.

Apple's much-hyped first futuristic headset hit the shelf on Feb. 2 and would be its first foray into the virtual reality ecosystem. Despite fizzling interest in the metaverse, this isn't the first time a tech giant has delved into the VR sector. Vision Pro would be a competitor to tech giant Meta's (formerly Facebook) existing ""Meta Quest"" headset.

businessinsiderssa,2024-02-10,285,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3KyxGeCN1f/,"The OpenAI CEO made the comments in a post on X on Friday, days after the Vision Pro officially hit the market for $3,500 each.

The mixed-reality headset allows users to interact with digital media, which is integrated with the real world. Users can control the device's app via their own eyes and fingers.

Business Insider reporter Jordan Hart said the device has the potential to usher in a new normal — just like Apple's iPhone did more than 15 years ago.

But as revolutionary as the new tech might be, Altman said he considers the Vision Pro to be only the ""second most impressive"" device to emerge in the last 17 years.

He didn't clarify what he thinks the most impressive technology is, but it's safe to assume he was referring to artificial intelligence — and perhaps OpenAI's ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022.

Altman has previously said AI is on track to change the world in ways not seen since the iPhone put a computer in people's pockets.

ChatGPT has already started to influence industry and daily life in unprecedented ways. Altman reportedly told developers that he wants to make ChatGPT into a ""supersmart personal assistant"" for work.

But even though Altman loves ChatGPT, he doesn't necessarily love its name. In response to his Friday X post, another user suggested Vision Pro had a bad name.

""chatgpt is a lot worse,"" Altman followed up.

This isn't the first time Altman has maligned OpenAI's now-household name.

""It's a horrible name but it may be too ubiquitous to ever change,"" Altman told Trevor Noah on the comedian's podcast, ""What Now? with Trevor Noah"" in December."

This weekend I had a choice of Vegas or stay home, tons of missed parties, celeb meetings, networking and fun.

But I picked home, as I had a todo list the size of my arm after 2 months filming a TV show.

It’s amazing what you can do in just one weekend…

Some people snooze and take it off, others work and get super productive.

Just this weekend in about 10 hours of work (5 hr both days) I was able to:

🎬 Plan and film some of a new YouTube series.

🤖 Scale marketing & ads for a LIVE A.I. event I have this week with @margaritapasos over 15,000 people registered. 

💪 Workout 3 times! 

📸 Do a magazine cover photoshoot!

🎤 Map out a new event with @thelesbrown

🏝️ Two Beach walks 

🦈 Finalize a new product with the OG Shark @realkevinharrington 

🥽 Finish my Vision Pro video 

The list goes on, but the point of this post is to pick your weekends carefully. They can become a MASSIVE competitive advantage if used wisely.

A new report from The Information reveals the company is developing “at least two” iPhone prototypes that fold horizontally, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip devices.

We are unlikely to see a folding iPhone anytime soon, if at all, as The Information reports the device isn’t in the company’s mass production plans for 2024 or 2025. Even though the company reportedly wants to create a foldable iPhone with displays on the outside of the device, The Information says engineers “struggled” with the design because it can break easily.Additionally, engineers also reportedly want to develop a foldable that’s “as thin as current iPhone models,” but battery sizes and display components make this a challenge. So far, Apple has spoken with “at least one” manufacturer in Asia about procuring parts for foldable iPhones of different sizes, The Information reports.Work is still underway on Apple’s long-rumored folding iPad, too. According to The Information, Apple is looking into developing a folding tablet that’s around the same size as an iPad Mini with an eight-inch display. Apple engineers working on the product are reportedly in the process of trying to reduce the crease that appears in the center of the display and also want to develop a hinge that allows the display to lie flat when unfolded.

It’s still not clear when Apple could release a folding iPad, either, but a recent report from The Elec suggests Apple is readying a seven- or eight-inch device for 2026 or 2027."

insidertech,2024-02-11,5281,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Npq3SuU9U/,"The reviews are in, and the tech press is lauding the Apple Vision Pro headset for delivering on the company’s promises. 

Still, this is a new gadget frontier. The Vision Pro, like the similarly kitted-out Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta, uses what’s known as “passthrough” video — cameras and other sensors that capture imagery of the outside world and reproduce it inside the device.

That, unfortunately, could have some very weird and very messy consequences for the human brain.

✅ Pros: 
- AVP allowed me to “focus” more (when I wasn’t busy exploring what apps I can use) and have multiple screens. 
- Also using gaze + pinch made some things faster than trying to find your mouse on your screen.

❌ Cons: 
- Figuring out where to put all the screens was challenging… my neck started to hurt looking up so much. Still need to figure out optimal screen sizes and placement. 
- The mouse on my MacBook Pro didn’t always work as intended. You can use your trackpad & keyboard from mbp on Vision Pro apps but sometimes when typing, instead of typing in the Vision Pro app, it would type on the mbp. 
- Most importantly, I couldn’t enjoy the beautiful blue skies in San Diego cause of the dimmed passthrough.

More detailed thoughts in a video soon but those are some high level! What are some tips you all have on how to best use AVP for work?

Just did a demo. Been a tech early adopter all my life. Fanatic about emerging tech, especially around education and entertainment. 

This is expensive. But. It's 100% the right direction. And I'll probably get one. Just like everything Apple has done, it isn't a unique idea (ipod, watch, laptop, iPad, ear buds all weren't their novel ideas), but it's an idea that's ... perfected.

Toto pred 3 dňami tweetoval Sam Altman, zakladateľ a CEO v OpenAI, ktorá stojí za ChatGPT. V piatok vyšiel Apple Vision Pro a v priebehu niekoľkých hodín sa predalo 200K+ zariadení v cene 3500USD. V Európe sa budú predávať až koncom roka. Zatiaľ je toto zariadenie povolené len pre USA trh, ale mal som možnosť si ich vyskúšať a moje prvé subjektívne dojmy:
- skúšal som alebo videl asi všetky Quest-y (Meta), Pico (ByteDance), ThinkReality VRX (Lenovo)... ale Vision Pro je úplne inde, už na prvý dojem je to iná liga;
- obraz je naozaj neskutočne kvalitný, a je už ťažko rozlíšitelný od reality, komfort a váha toho zariadenia vás vtiahne až tak, že zabudnete, že ho máte na očiach;
- ovládanie zrakom funguje naozaj veľmi dobre už v tejto prvej verzii;
- dá sa s ním relatívne komfortne chodiť po meste a využívať pri tom extra features, ako maps, poznámky, video,…
- dajú sa na ňom sledovať 3D filmy, ako na ľubovoľne veľkom plátne;
- vedel by som s ním už teraz pracovať 8h a mať ho ako náhradu za veľký monitor alebo viac monitorov.

Je to slepá ulička alebo disruptívna technológia, ktorá zásadne zmení svet? Uvažovali ste nás tým, ako zmení eCommerce? 😁"

tnn_tech,2024-02-12,10,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3O0ejdKHD2/,"ลือ ! Apple อาจซุ่มทำ iPhone และ iPad จอพับได้หลังปล่อย Vision Pro

มีรายงานจากเว็บไซต์ ดิ อินฟอเมชัน (The Information) ซึ่งเป็นแหล่งข่าวเทคโนโลยีที่นำเสนอการวิเคราะห์เชิงลึกและข่าวสารเกี่ยวกับบริษัทเทคโนโลยีรายใหญ่ ๆ ระบุว่า แอปเปิล (Apple) กำลังพัฒนาต้นแบบของไอโฟน (iPhone) อย่างน้อย 2 รุ่นที่สามารถพับได้ คล้ายกับ กาแล็กซี่ ฟลิบ (Galaxy Z Flip) จากค่ายคู่แข่งฝั่งแอนดรอยด์อย่าง ซัมซุง (Samsung)

อย่างไรก็ตาม เราอาจจะยังไม่ได้เห็น iPhone แบบพับได้ในเร็ว ๆ นี้ เนื่องจาก The Information รายงานว่า อุปกรณ์ดังกล่าวยังไม่อยู่ในแผนการผลิตขนาดใหญ่ของบริษัทที่จะเกิดขึ้นในปี 2024 หรือ 2025 และถึงแม้ว่า Apple จะอยากพัฒนา iPhone จอพับได้ ที่มีจอแสดงผลอยู่ด้านนอกของอุปกรณ์ แต่ทว่าในปัจจุบัน วิศวกรของบริษัทก็ยังคงต้องเผชิญกับปัญหาการออกแบบหน้าจอที่ค่อนข้างซับซ้อน และเจอกับปัญหาหน้าจอที่สามารถแตกหักได้ง่าย

โดยรายงานระบุว่า iPhone จอพับได้ที่วิศวกรต้องการพัฒนาขึ้นนี้ ตั้งเป้าไว้ว่าจะต้องมีความบางเท่ากับเครื่อง iPhone รุ่นปัจจุบัน แต่ทว่าด้วยขนาดแบตเตอรี่ และส่วนประกอบของจอแสดงผล ทำให้การพัฒนาจริงนั้นไม่ง่าย

อย่างไรก็ตาม ข่าวดีก็คือ Apple ได้พูดคุยกับผู้ผลิตแล้ว “อย่างน้อยหนึ่งราย” ในเอเชีย เกี่ยวกับการจัดหาชิ้นส่วนสำหรับผลิต iPhone แบบพับได้ในขนาดต่าง ๆ อ้างอิงตามข้อมูลที่ The Information รายงาน

ส่วนข่าว iPad แบบพับได้ของ Apple ที่ลุ้นกันมานาน ก็อาจจะต้องร้องเพลงรอกันต่อไป เพราะในรายงานเดียวกันนี้ระบุว่า Apple กำลังพัฒนาแท็บเล็ตแบบพับได้ ที่มีขนาดใกล้เคียงกับ iPad Mini โดยจะมีหน้าจอแสดงผลขนาด 8 นิ้ว แต่ยังอยู่ในระหว่างการพัฒนาบานพับ และการทำให้รอยพับที่ปรากฏขึ้นกลางจอ เกิดขึ้นน้อยลง

สรุปว่าจากรายงานทั้งหมดนี้ หากเป็นจริง แฟน ๆ ค่ายผลไม้ ที่กำลังรอจะได้เห็น iPhone และ iPad แบบพับได้ ก็อาจจะยังมีหวัง แต่คงต้องลุ้นเอาใจช่วยให้ Apple หาวิธีเอาชนะอุปสรรคทางเทคนิคให้ได้ ซึ่งก็ไม่แน่ว่าถ้า Apple ทำได้จริง iPhone หรือ iPad รุ่นต่อ ๆ ไป อาจจะมีลูกเล่นมากกว่าแค่จอพับได้ ออกมาเซอร์ไพรส์ให้เราร้องว้าวไปตาม ๆ กัน

markkwan,2024-02-12,36,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3PEr8yuSvs/,"2024-02-03: Saturday.  Las Vegas to Los Angeles. 
Started the day with the U2 Popup Shop at the Venetian.  If you’re going to Vegas and are a fan of U2, it’s definitely worth a look.  Lots of merch from the residency as well as some fun installations to take photos with.

Breakfast @ Orchids Garden - a Cantonese speaking dim sum house for locals.  Say what you want, but the Asian food scene in Las Vegas is top notch.  You just have to know where to look.  For such a small city and so many people passing through, it has to stay competitive with quality and pricing.  This meal was great, and the pork buns were *chefs kiss*.

Took Archie to the airport as he returns to NYC.

Paid a visit to @dansellslasvegas who would unlive me if I went to Vegas without seeing her.  Previously Apple, now thriving as a real estate agent in Sin City.  Also explained to me what a BBL is.

Went to Cesar’s to get some overpriced Cronuts, followed by the Apple Store to pick up MY APPLE VISION PRO!  Man we are heading into another WORLD!

One last stop at Dutch Bros before driving to Barstow to check out a McDonald’s in a train car, then really bad Taco Bell in Hawthorne followed by playing around with the Apple Vision Pro for the rest of the night.

Thought of the day:  Las Vegas is and will always be a weird and strange place.  No two people will share the same love for it.  Even if two people travel together, and go to the same events, their takeaway and thoughts of Vegas will be different.  It’s such a choose your own adventure where every sense is heightened and there’s just so much … stimulation.  Every time I go, I think I know what to expect and it’s a whole different experience.  The thought of moving there has been on my mind for the last two decades but every time I visit I dilly dally on it.  What are your thoughts on Las Vegas?"

⁣
Memanfaatkan rasa penasaran konsumen, perusahaan di China mengambil peluang dengan membuat Vision Pro KW yang harganya jauh lebih murah. Konsumen hanya perlu mengeluarkan dana USD 500. Ini setara HP flagship Android harga Rp 7 jutaan.⁣
⁣
Secara tampilan memang tidak semewah Vision Pro. Tapi yang mengejutkan user interfacenya dibuat mirip VisionOS. Perbedaan terbesar, kacamata ini tidak memiliki layar EyeSight seperti Vision Pro milik Apple, yang membantu memperlihatkan mata pemakainya kepada orang di sekitarnya.⁣
⁣
Vision Pro KW memiliki dua kamera besar di bagian depan. Selain itu, ia juga tidak memiliki kemampuan untuk melacak pergerakan mata dan gerakan tangan penggunanya.⁣

Dengan harga jauh lebih murah, kekurangan tersebut cukup dimaklumi. Minat coba, detikers?⁣

I visited the Apple store recently and took a demo of the Apple Vision Pro, and I was amazed. 🤩

I have tried the Meta Quest before so I kind of knew what to expect. But it surpassed my expectations. 

Here are 3 things I absolutely loved about the Vision Pro:

1) I was amazed at the accuracy of eyeball tracking - it literally moves the cursor ( just like your laptop) to the point on the screen you are looking at.

2) Their Immersive movie is just mind-blowing. I don’t want to give you any spoilers but imagine experiencing your favorite cricket/ baseball match from close up.. 

3) The ability to resize apps, and move them around based on your convenience while having the most realistic background ( a large mountain and lake with small droplets of light rain) is another level of wow.

It is going to transform how we watch movies, interact with our surroundings, and travel the world! 

I just wish it was pocket-friendly and less bulky! 😃🤷🏻‍♀️

Also, if you are curious about Vision Pro, I highly recommend taking the demo which is free of cost. 🤑

Have you tried the Apple Vision Pro? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.⬇️💭

lgbtqnation,2024-02-13,33,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3TU6DJATw-/,"Apple has begun selling its Vision Pro virtual reality (VR) goggles. Like other goggles in the newly expanding VR market, its technology can help users experience three-dimensional (3D) immersive films that allow them to literally hear and see events from other people’s points of view (POV). Research suggests such films could help the goggles become a kind of “empathy machine” to increase users’ understanding of marginalized people’s life experiences, including LGBTQ+ folks.

So far, many VR films have sought to immerse viewers in the POVs of hospitalized medical patients, workers experiencing racism, and people living in refugee camps. While some researchers remain skeptical about the technology’s ability to inspire long-lasting empathy overall, a growing number of LGBTQ+ VR films are nonetheless immersing viewers in queer experiences as well.

The journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s been filled with growth and learning every step of the way. I’ve been a bit quiet lately, focusing on healing and work, but I’m eager to reconnect and share more with you all. 🔄💪

My trusty Apple Vision Pro has been a lifeline, transforming into the ultimate mobile office as we prepare for an exciting trip to Palm Springs. We’re heading out this Friday to make the most of Presidents’ Day weekend, ahead of the International Bear Convergence (IBC) the following week. The blend of excitement and nerves is real—pondering how my back will handle the adventure, especially with the pool’s beckoning. Yet, we’re moving forward with optimism and a splash of adventurous spirit. 🌴🏊‍♂️

In the hustle of it all, I missed this month’s Arizona Leather Bears and Cubs (ALBAC) event, caught up in a whirlwind of coding. And I’ve barely mentioned our Pokeno nights at Nu Towne Saloon! Last night, I was so close to winning the jackpot, which now stands at a whopping $1,800 for the next round. We’ll be missing out next week, but who knows, maybe one of you will claim it, or perhaps it’ll climb to $2k by the time we’re back? 😜💰

With so much to do before we set off for PS this Friday, the anticipation is mounting. I appreciate all the support and patience you’ve shown me through my recovery journey and this bustling season. 

Your encouragement has been invaluable. Can’t wait to share our Presidents’ Day weekend adventures with you—GayPHX is on the move, ready for sun, fun, and hopefully some gentle poolside rehab for my back. Here’s to creating new memories and sharing every step of this journey with you. Love y’all! 🚗💨❤️ #RecoveryJourney #GayPHXOnTheRoad #GayPHX #PresidentsDayWeekend #IBC #PokenoNights"

The Black-Mirror like AR/VR headset has changed the way we look at tech ecosystems. The launch left the internet divided as users were seen with the device in public spaces - doing all sorts of bizarre things!

@afrojack hopped onto the Vision Trend to try producing! His video looked very promising- AR/VR headsets have the possibility of giving the users a spatial freedom without the need of additional space!

This unlocks a new wave of digital possibilities! As we progress into the area of AI, we might start witnessing large format events in digital spaces with complete intuitive interactions!

The 2020 virtual Tomorrowland festival proved that we are highly capable of such large format executions! 

What do you think , how soon will we witness fully AR/VR live large format events?

⁠
Regardless of the headset's passthrough camera technology, it's not a pair of smart glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans. ⁠
⁠
The Vision Pro may look like it's got a see-through window to the outside world, but it doesn't. It's a completely enclosed VR headset that uses passthrough cameras to convey what's outside your headset. If the battery dies or gets disconnected, if it reboots suddenly or fails in some way, you'll be flying, walking or driving blind.⁠
⁠
This is not even including how it's nearly impossible to use the headset in Travel Mode anywhere outside of an airplane, or possibly a train. ⁠

⁠
Who doesn’t love Apple products? I adore my desktop, laptop, Apple TV, iPad, Airbuds and whatever is the latest iPhone update on any given day.⁠
⁠
But I’m not a tech geek. I am a Luddite sheep posing as a techie wolf.⁠
⁠
I never bought an Apple Watch or any other digital assisted-living companions. I do own an Oculus that was gifted to me for the purpose of doing cardio. But … since it’s not Apple, it sits with other dormant gadgets in my closet, along with a large light ring and digital retro-microphone left over from COVID-era Zoom meetings.⁠
⁠
Oculus sucked me in and spit me out of the bowels of augmented reality within minutes.⁠
⁠
Yet despite these travails I’ve eagerly anticipated the introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, which promises a better (stress-free) user experience that is as easy to operate as touching my thumb and index fingers together. By softly sliding two digits in the air like a Tom Cruise Minority Report gesture, one makes images that move and applications that create enveloping illusions.⁠

Entering the chat is Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has more at stake than perhaps anyone on earth if Apple does to headsets what the iPhone did to smartphones. In a video posted to his Instagram account on Tuesday, Zuckerberg gives his official verdict on the Vision Pro versus his company’s latest Quest 3 headset: “I don’t just think that Quest is the better value, I think Quest is the better product, period.”

While being filmed by the Quest 3’s video passthrough system in his living room, Zuckerberg highlights the tradeoffs Apple made to get the fanciest display possible into something that can be worn on your head in an acceptable form factor. He says the Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less, making it more comfortable to wear for longer. He also says it allows for greater motion due to its lack of a wired battery pack and wider field of view than the Vision Pro.

pcmag,2024-02-14,1150,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3VfyrurSxI/,"Most VR headsets require a choice: Convenience or power. Standalone headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and the Meta Quest Pro are convenient because you can use them on their own with nothing attached. The trade-off is that they use mobile processors that aren't as powerful as computers.

The Apple Vision Pro, however, uses the same chip that powers the 2022 MacBook Pro. We decided to stand on business and benchmark the Vision Pro, just like we would a MacBook.

We can tell you this: The M2 isn't Apple's fastest processor, but it easily makes the Vision Pro more powerful than any Meta Quest headset.

Starting with Geekbench 6, which rates raw CPU power, the Vision Pro scored 2,444 on the single-core test and 7,845 on the multi-core test. It got 6,058 in the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme test, and a frame rate of 90fps in the GFXBench Aztec High-Tier 1440p Offscreen test. While we haven't used it to test many devices in the last year, we also ran Antutu on the Vision Pro and it got a score of 2,021,940.

Now, these are not direct comparisons to any of the Meta Quest devices. We compared the two flagship headsets last week in our feature titled “Apple Vision Pro vs. Meta Quest Pro: Mixed Reality Matchup”. While the Meta Quest Pro won on price (obviously) and battery life, we still gave the overall win to the Vision Pro. Here’s what we had to say:

“Apple's first entry into the category is incredible on every front, with the best cameras, display, and processor we've seen from a device of this type, along with a groundbreaking control scheme that eschews physical handheld controllers. There's no denying that the Vision Pro is the most advanced and the most intuitive mixed reality headset there is, but the barrier of entry to this new platform is very high, and whether it's worth $3,500 is up to you and your budget.”

Sorry, Zuck.

In a video posted on his social media, he said Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less, making it more comfortable to wear for longer. He also says it allows for greater motion due to its lack of a wired battery pack and wider field of view than the Vision Pro.

verge,2024-02-14,22170,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3V-S8MPutG/,"For some Apple Vision Pro buyers, the honeymoon is already over.

It’s no coincidence that there’s been an uptick on social media of Vision Pro owners saying they’re returning their $3,500 headsets in the past few days. Apple allows you to return any product within 14 days of purchase — and for the first wave of Vision Pro buyers, we’re right about at that point.

Comfort is among the most cited reasons for returns. People have said the headset gives them headaches and triggers motion sickness. The weight of the device, and the fact that most of it is front-loaded, has been another complaint. Parker Ortolani, The Verge’s product manager, told me that he thought using the device led to a burst blood vessel in his eye. At least one other person noted they had a similar experience with redness. (To be fair, VR headset users have anecdotally reported dry eyes and redness for years.)

เปิดตัว Huawei Vision Pro 
เบา-ถูกกว่า Apple เกือบครึ่ง 
.
Huawei Vision Pro แว่นตาอัจฉริยะที่ทางหัวเว่ยพัฒนามาเป็นเวลาหลายปีแล้ว ซึ่งได้จดทะเบียนทางการค้าไว้ตั้งแต่ปี 2019 ซึ่งอาจทำให้ Apple Vision Pro ต้องเปลี่ยนชื่อในเร็วๆนี้ โดยแว่น Huawei Vision Pro มีข้อได้เปรียบทั้งราคาที่ถูกกว่าเกือบครึ่ง และยังมีน้ำหนักที่เบากว่าอีกด้วย
.
แว่นอัจฉริยะ Huawei Vision Pro จะมาพร้อมหน้าจอ micro OLED หรือ OLED Microdisplay ความละเอียด 4K ของ Sony ซึ่งเหมือนกับของ Apple Vision Pro และมีน้ำหนักเพียง 350 กรัม เบากว่า Apple Vision Pro เกือบครึ่ง แต่จะไม่มีฟีเจอร์ Eyesight ที่สามารถแสดงดวงตาขณะใส่ที่แอปเปิลทำได้ 
.
ส่วนราคาของแว่นนั้นคาดว่าจะจำหน่ายอยู่ที่ 15,000 หยวน หรือราวๆ 75,000 บาท เมื่อเทียบกับคู่แข่งอย่าง Apple ในตอนนี้ถือว่าเข้าถึงง่ายกว่าเป็นเท่าตัว 
.
Huawei ยังมี Vision Glass ที่เป็นหน้าจอเสมือนซึ่งใช้แคปซูลอากาศและแผ่นรองจมูกที่ผู้ใช้สามารถปรับตำแหน่งต่างๆ ได้ 3 ตำแหน่งตามความสะดวกซึ่งก็น่าสนใจว่าหากเปิดตัวออกมาจะเจ๋งแค่ไหน
.
อีกไม่นานในปีนี้เราจะได้มีโอกาสได้เห็น Huawei Vision S ซึ่งเป็นทีวีรุ่นใหม่ของทางหัวเว่ยที่คาดว่าจะใช้คู่กับแว่น Huawei Vision Pro และเราจะได้รู้กันว่าหัวเว่ยจะมาเอาชนะและต่อสู้กับคู่แข่งอย่าง Apple Vision Pro ได้หรือไม่

Developed at Cedars-Sinai's extended-reality lab, humanoid robot Xaia offers personalized care using proven psychotherapeutic techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive talk therapy and motivational interviewing.⁠
⁠
Xaia stands for eXtended reality Artificially Intelligent Ally; the platform uses AI to analyze current conversations and synthesize information from past sessions to generate helpful responses. Fostering a sense of empathy and connection, Xaia makes eye contact and can produce a wide array of true-to-life facial expressions. While she isn't meant to be a substitute for human therapists, issues within Xaia's scope include such topics as divorce, lay-offs, interpersonal problems and mild depression and anxiety. ⁠
⁠
For an additional layer of engagement, sessions aren't conducted in an office-like setting. Instead, the platform leverages Apple Vision Pro's next-level resolution and spatial computing to create highly detailed biophilic VR environments that augment a patient's emotional state. A therapy session might be offered in a lush forest, while an AI-tailored meditation could transport the user to a beach at dawn.⁠

He noted that the Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less, making it more comfortable to wear for longer and allows for greater motion due to its lack of a wired battery pack and wider field of view.

itstrendingpakistan,2024-02-14,109,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Vh-eiL0pI/,"Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, has claimed that the Meta Quest 3 VR headset is a “better product” than the Apple Vision Pro, which costs 7x more. 

In a video, he compared the two devices and highlighted the advantages of the Quest 3, such as its comfort, performance, controllers, and content library. He also criticized the Vision Pro for its motion blur, weight, and lack of immersive games. 

Zuckerberg said that he wants Meta to be the open model for the next generation of computing, and that he hopes the Quest 3 will win over the Vision Pro.

menclub,2024-02-14,194,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3UjWjFrmdQ/,"【科技】Apple Vision Pro團隊成員認為至少第4代才能達到「理想形態」

Apple混合實境(MR)頭戴式裝置Vision Pro日前於美國正式開賣，即使要價高達3,499美金仍吸引唔少果迷入手，網上亦陸續出現各種頭戴Vision Pro行街，搭地鐵，甚至揸車等影片。然而，有參與Vision Pro開發嘅員工就認為，Vision Pro至要等到第4代先能達到Apple嘅預期目標。

著名科技記者Mark Gurman日前於《Bloomberg》專欄Power On指出，雖然Vision Pro在影片串流，提升工作生產力以及硬件表現等方面非常出色，並能夠喺床上、飛機上、梳化上等場景取代電腦，但仍存在電池續航力低、機身笨重、專屬應用程式不足、visionOS問題多多等缺點。

因此，Mark Gurman認為目前嘅Vision Pro本質上只係一部原型產品，一部需要用家付費購買才能獲得測試權嘅原型機，並提到Vision Pro開發員工都認為，Vision Pro至少要等到第4代先能達到「理想形態」，類似於iPhone、iPad及Apple Watch嘅發展軌跡，若然Apple能夠解決相關問題，Vision Pro最終可能會取代iPad。

businessinsiderssa,2024-02-14,339,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3UvMtKCVa0/,"But nearly two weeks after its release, first impressions of the futuristic gadget appear to have soured for some buyers, who say they're returning the $3,500 device.

One major reason Vision Pro customers say they want a refund: its seemingly clunky design. Farzad Mesbahi, who regularly creates YouTube videos about tech, says that wearing a device on his head and face can be inconvenient even if he can get it to sit comfortably. He can't see himself using the headset for long periods as people do with smartphones, tablets, and computers.

""For a technology/productivity device, this is a non-starter for me,"" Mesbahi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Collin Michael, a self-proclaimed Apple nerd, would agree with him. In a YouTube video he uploaded on why he's returning his Vision Pro, he says the device's weight is ""noticeable"" enough to be a burden. Using the headset to do things he would normally do on an iPhone or Mac — like pulling up Safari or searching for used cars, he says — requires extra steps that just aren't worth the effort.

Some Redditors who claim to be returning the Vision Pro also referenced how uncomfortable it is to wear the headset.

Disappointment in the headset's vision quality is another gripe expressed by Vision Pro customers.

Mesbahi wrote on X that the device's ability to overlay virtual apps on top of a user's line of vision is ""not good"" when it comes to clearly observing his surroundings. When looking at real objects, Mesbahi says his line of vision is ""still quite grainy in most lighting conditions.""

For instance, when he looks at his computer or iPhone, he says the image quality ""isn't nearly sharp enough to make out what's on the screen."" The same goes for reading a paper with small font.

Michael noted how he needs to turn his head to look at different elements on the screen because there are ""giant black edges"" along its perimeter that blur and distort ""10 to 20 percent"" of his line of vision. Similarly, when he casts his MacBook onto his headset, he says the icons on the bottom of the laptop screen are difficult to decipher."

He highlights the Quest’s strengths in areas like price, design, comfort, versatility, image quality, input methods, and content library.

Zuckerberg suggests that despite having a lower price point, the Quest 3 significantly outperforms the pricier Vision Pro in most aspects. He draws parallels to past computing generations and advocates for an open model in the mixed reality space that Meta embodies with the Quest series.

Overall, Zuckerberg positions the Quest 3 as the superior choice for most users based on its well-rounded capabilities and excellent value.

.
Apple Vision Pro ถือเป็นแกดเจ็ตที่คนทั่วโลกให้ความสนใจและได้กระแสตอบรับในวันเปิดตัวเป็นอย่างดี แต่ล่าสุดได้มีลูกค้าในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้นำ Vision Pro มาคืนเงินเป็นจำนวนมาก ซึ่งให้เหตุผลว่าหลังได้ซื้อไปใช้งานจริงแล้วไม่เวิร์ก น้ำหนักมากไปและสวมใส่ไม่สบาย ทำให้ไม่สามารถใช้งานได้ทุกวัน
.
เว็บไซต์ Cult of Mac ได้รวบรวมข้อมูลในสื่อโซเชียล X จึงพบว่ามีอินฟลูเอนเซอร์และผู้มีชื่อเสียงหลายคน ก็ได้อนำ Vision Pro ไปขอคืนเงินกัน โดยเหตุผลหลักยอดนิยมที่คืนคือ หนัก, สวมใส่ไม่สบายและรู้สึกว่าไม่สามารถใช้งานได้ทุกๆวัน 
.
ZeroHedge ยังได้พบว่าใน Google Trends ได้มีคำค้นหาเกี่ยวกับกฎการขอคืนสินค้า โดยเฉพาะ Apple Vision Pro มีจำนวนเพิ่มมากขึ้นในช่วงสัปดาห์ที่ผ่านมา ชี้ให้เห็นว่า Apple Vision Pro อาจไม่ประสบความสำเร็จในด้านยอดขายหากมีคนคืนเงินเป็นจำนวนมาก
.
มีกูรูหลายคนให้ความเห็นว่าถึงแม้เทคโนโลยีใน Vision Pro จะดีมากก็ตาม แต่ก็พบว่ายังหาเหตุผลไม่ได้มากพอที่จะซื้อและใช้งานต่อไป เป็นไปได้ว่าภาพการใช้งานจริงจะชัดเจนขึ้นในรุ่นถัดไปมากกว่า
.
ซึ่งก่อนหน้ามีข้อมูลว่า Vision Pro ขายไปได้ในช่วงแรกประมาณ 180,000 ชุด ซึ่งต้องรอดูว่าจำนวนที่มาทำเรื่องขอคืนเงินมีมากแค่ไหน เราคงต้องติดตามกันอีกทีว่า Apple จะออกมาแก้เกมนี้อย่างไรบ้าง

TikTok has launched a native and “reimagined” app on the Apple Vision Pro. Although you could watch TikTok videos via your browser on the Vision Pro, the new native app allows for a more immersive viewing experience.

In the TikTok Vision Pro app, the navigation bar and like button are moved off-screen to allow for full video viewing, while the comment section and creator profiles appear as expansions on the side of the feed.

The app lets you watch TikTok videos in immersive locations, like in Yosemite or on the moon. It also works with the device’s Shared Space feature, which means you can watch TikTok videos while working on other apps.

For Apple fans or some Apple Vision Pro buyers, the honeymoon is already over.

It’s no coincidence that there’s been an uptick on social media of Vision Pro owners saying they’re returning their $3,500 headsets in the past few days. Apple allows you to return any product within 14 days of purchase — and for the first wave of Vision Pro buyers, we’re right about at that point.

Comfort is among the most cited reasons for returns. People have said the headset gives them headaches and triggers motion sickness. The weight of the device, and the fact that most of it is front-loaded, has been another complaint. Parker Ortolani, The Verge’s product manager, told me that he thought using the device led to a burst blood vessel in his eye. At least one other person noted they had a similar experience with redness. (To be fair, VR headset users have anecdotally reported dry eyes and redness for years.)

- Meetings, wow same thing, try joining a zoom or Teams call without them and you’re entire call has to be on speaker or you’re self conscious that you’re gonna be the clown to enable video of the side of your face the entire call. 
- Music, not top of the list but I listened to zero music today because I didn’t have my glasses and there was no reason to play any on speaker. 
- Siri, yea I use Siri, especially since it’s super attentive when n the Vision Pro, and accurate, so using it on my phone now I’m repeating myself or just not enabling it.  Weird but I only noticed later
- AI, useless still since the glasses are just another Bluetooth device and Siri is sufficient.

• Quest can do the mixed-reality-floating screen thing that Apple calls ""spatial computing,"" except Meta's goggles start at $500, compared to $3,500 for Vision Pro⁠
• Quest doesn't have a wired battery pack and is still a bar of soap lighter than the Vision Pro, which some have criticized for causing headaches and neck pain. ⁠

Zuck admitted that Apple ""fanboys"" get upset whenever anyone dares question the tech giant, but he did admit that the Vision Pro's screen resolution is superior and that the eye-tracking function is ""really nice."" ⁠

In a video posted to his Instagram account, Zuckerberg compared the headset to the iPhone, highlighting the tradeoffs made to get the best display into a headset that can be worn on the head in an acceptable form factor.

He noted that the Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less, making it more comfortable to wear for longer and allows for greater motion due to its lack of a wired battery pack and wider field of view. Zuckerberg also praised the Quest’s option of physical hand controllers and hand tracking for input, though he admits that the Vision Pro is a better entertainment device.

The Quest 3 is also seven times less expensive.

startuppakistansp,2024-02-15,1009,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3YBSFAIuKO/,"Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, compared the Meta Quest 3 with Apple's Vision Pro and said the Quest 3 is better and cheaper. He mentioned that the Quest 3 performs better, is lighter, and costs less than Apple's VR headset.

Zuckerberg shared a video on Instagram where he tried out the Apple Vision Pro and concluded that the Quest 3 is not only cheaper but also superior in every aspect. He pointed out that the Quest 3 is lighter, more flexible, and has a wider field of view compared to the Vision Pro. Additionally, he praised the Quest 3's better motion performance and wireless design.

Moreover, Zuckerberg highlighted the significant price difference between the Quest 3 and the Vision Pro, stating that the Quest 3 is about seven times cheaper. While it's common for tech CEOs to test their competitors' devices, some criticized Zuckerberg for underselling the Vision Pro in his comparison. Despite acknowledging that the Vision Pro is better for entertainment, Zuckerberg emphasized the advantages of the Quest 3. However, both headsets have their own advantages and shortcomings.

cnbc,2024-02-15,1231,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3WK1YmrerT/,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his opinion of Apple’s new mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, in a video posted to Instagram where he called Meta’s Quest 3 headset “the better value” and “the better product, period.”

Zuckerberg, in the video posted on Tuesday, said he thinks the Quest headset is “a lot more comfortable,” its immersive content library is deeper, its field of view is wider, its hand tracking is more accurate and its screen is brighter compared to the Vision Pro. However, he noted that Apple’s screen has a higher resolution and that its eye tracking is “really nice.”

“It seems like there are a lot of people who just assumed that Vision Pro would be higher quality because it’s Apple and it costs $3,000 more, but honestly, I’m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for, with that price differential,” Zuckerberg said.

While it’s obvious Zuckerberg would promote his company’s product, his decision to post a video about the differences between the Quest 3 and Vision Pro shows the increasing competition between Apple and Meta.

⁠
As @insiderbusiness reports, a tide of users who quickly snatched up Apple's expensive new face computer are returning the pricey headsets. Specific reasons for returning the devices vary, but across the board, it seems that many users just don't think the uncomfortable devices are worth the hefty price tag — yet, at least.⁠
⁠
One of the most-cited cons to the Apple Pro is the headset's weight. Although Apple's attempted to offset the weight issue with what has to be the thickest head strap we've ever seen, its still proving to be a serious problem for users.⁠
⁠
""Well after two days I am sad to report that I will be returning Apple Vision Pro,"" one disappointed Vision Pro buyer wrote in the r/VisionPro subreddit, noting that while the operating system itself is perfectly functional, the device ""is very heavy and uncomfortable to wear and I cannot imagine using for any extended period of time.""⁠
⁠
Technology YouTuber Farzad Mesbahi had a similar critique, writing on X/Twitter: ""Regardless of how comfortable I get Vision Pro to be on my head, it's still a hurdle.""⁠

In a video posted to his Instagram account, Zuckerberg compared the headset to the iPhone, highlighting the tradeoffs made to get the best display into a headset that can be worn on the head in an acceptable form factor.

He noted that the Quest 3 weighs 120 grams less, making it more comfortable to wear for longer and allows for greater motion due to its lack of a wired battery pack and wider field of view. Zuckerberg also praised the Quest’s option of physical hand controllers and hand tracking for input, though he admits that the Vision Pro is a better entertainment device.

The Quest 3 is also seven times less expensive.

artreview_magazine,2024-02-15,8,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Xa32Ds3TB/,"Apple’s much-hyped ‘mixed reality’ device, Vision Pro, hit is a newly invasive means of capturing our attention, the purest expression of the world as a ‘one-person space’, Lewis Gordon writes.⁠
⁠
These are the two seemingly oppositional sides of the Vision Pro: interior and exterior, the user’s perception and how they are perceived. In his history of Japanese virtual reality, media scholar Paul Roquet describes VR as a ‘perceptual enclosure’, drawing a line between these headset technologies and the agricultural movement in England stemming from the 1600s that saw common lands ‘enclosed’ for private landlords. Where previous VR models place you in an entirely new virtual environment, closing off the real world in a manner that is admirably upfront, the Vision Pro is more insidious about public space: you still physically inhabit it but less so – the world entirely refocused around a new, computer-oriented perception. If everyone were to wear these goggles, our public spaces (or what remains of them in an increasingly privatised world) would be degraded to little more than a forum for those who occupy what Roquet calls a ‘one-person space’, the greatest bulk of conversations happening between individuals and their OS.⁠

So-called tech bros have been strolling through public spaces with confidence, donning Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro headset on their faces while gesturing into the air. Dive into the comments on those videos and you’ll see a consistent ratio: about 20 percent of the commenters herald this as the future, and the other 80 mock it with vehement derision. 

Accordingly, we had to give Apple’s headset a go al fresco—and our senior editor Samuel Axon, in the second of his series of tests, took the pricey headset out onto the streets of Chicago.

“I’m setting out to answer a few questions here,” Axon writes. “Does it feel weird wearing it in public spaces? Will people judge you or react negatively when you wear it—and if so, will that become less common over time? Does it truly disconnect you from reality, and has Apple succeeded in solving virtual reality's isolationist tendencies?”

As it turns out, all these questions are closely related. Read about his experience taking this “spatial computing” device on the road via the link in our bio."

.
เป็นเรื่องที่หลีกเลี่ยงไม่ได้ที่เมื่อมีสินค้าที่มีฟังก์ชันคล้าย ๆ กัน ก็มักจะถูกนำมาเปรียบเทียบ ไม่เว้นแม้แต่เฮดเซ็ตอย่างวิชัน โปร (Vision Pro) ของแอปเปิล (Apple) และเควสต์ 3 (Quest 3) ของเมต้า (Meta) การเปรียบเทียบนี้ไม่ได้เกิดขึ้นจากผู้ใช้อย่างเรา ๆ เท่านั้น ล่าสุด มาร์ก ซักเคอร์เบิร์ก (Mark Zuckerberg) ซีอีโอของบริษัทเมต้าก็ออกมาทดลองใช้เพื่อเปรียบเทียบ เขาโพสต์วิดีโอลงอินสตาแกรมส่วนตัว และบอกว่า “ผมไม่เพียงคิดว่า Quest คุ้มค่ากว่า แต่ผมยังคิดว่า Quest เป็นผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ดีกว่า จบ”

ด้านรายละเอียดอื่น ๆ ซักเคอร์เบิร์กบอกว่า Quest 3 มีน้ำหนักน้อยกว่า 120 กรัม ทำให้สวมใส่สบายได้นานขึ้น และยังคล่องตัวกว่า เพราะไม่มีชุดแบตเตอรี่แบบมีสาย รวมถึงยังมีมุมมองกว้างกว่า Vision Pro ด้วย

ด้านการควบคุมทางกายภาพด้วยมือ รวมถึงระบบติดตามมือเพื่อป้อนข้อมูลของ Quest ก็ดีกว่า และยังบอกอีกว่า Quest มีคลังคอนเทนต์ที่ “ดื่มด่ำ (immersive)” กว่าของแอปเปิล ซักเกอร์เบิร์กยังได้กล่าวถึงเรื่องของราคาด้วยว่า “ราคา Quest 3 ถูกกว่าตั้ง 7 เท่าเลย” แต่ซักเคอร์เบิร์กก็ยอมรับว่า Vision Pro เป็นอุปกรณ์เพื่อความบันเทิงที่ดีกว่า

ทั้งนี้มีจุดน่าสนใจที่น่าพิจารณาจากอเล็กซ์ เฮลต์ (Alex Heath) รองบรรณาธิการด้านเทคโนโลยีจากสื่อดัง เดอะเวิร์จ (The Verge) ชี้ว่าเมต้ามีจุดเริ่มต้นด้านการขายเฮดเซ็ตที่ยอดเยี่ยมและยืนเป็นผู้นำระยะเวลาหนึ่ง แต่แอปเปิลมีข้อได้เปรียบด้านฮาร์ดแวร์และระบบนิเวศของนักพัฒนาที่ชัดเจน ซึ่งต้องการเวลาในการปรับปรุงหมวดหมู่ผลิตภัณฑ์ ดังนั้นจึงเป็นเรื่องที่น่าจับตามองในการแข่งขันเรื่องเฮดเซ็ต เพราะนี่ถือเป็นเพียงจุดเริ่มต้นเท่านั้น

อย่างไรก็ตาม สำหรับผู้ใช้งานและชื่นชอบเทคโนโลยีอย่างเรา ๆ การแข่งขันย่อมสามารถผลักดันให้เทคโนโลยีก้าวหน้าขึ้น รวมถึงเรื่องราคาที่สมเหตุสมผล ก็ถือเป็นการก้าวหน้าของเทคโนโลยีและนวัตกรรมที่น่าจับตามองจริง ๆ

shelly.palmer,2024-02-15,7,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3X5EUEr2KA/,"I love the Apple Vision Pro. It is the first truly inspiring portal to the augmented reality world we are evolving into. That said, a fair number of like-minded early adopters are returning their devices (inside the 14-day return window) for the same reasons every other AR/VR device is sitting on the “tech graveyard” shelf in my office: it’s not ready for daily use.

The number one complaint about the Apple Vision Pro is weight. Admittedly, the headset is quite heavy and front-loaded. It causes discomfort and headaches for some users and – I can personally attest – it can be painful to wear even for short periods. According to some users, the design and strap system can lead to eye strain, dizziness, and even motion sickness. I’ve seen this with other AR/VR offerings; my armchair research with our various demo days for other manufacturers showed that about 30% of users got a headache or became nauseated within about 15 minutes of use.

Another cited reason for returns is a lack of productivity. For $3,500, people expected more. Again, more armchair research says that people find it hard to use for work. It doesn’t multi-task, it doesn’t support as many file types as you need it to, and there is no improvement in productivity using gestures over a traditional mouse and keyboard.

While productivity is an issue, perhaps the most damning criticism is lack of entertainment value. There just isn’t enough software yet, and for this kind of investment, you just don’t want to get bored by your Apple Vision Pro.

Apple is pioneering a new space, and Apple Vision Pro is currently the best-in-class. However, at this price point – and at this point in the AR/VR journey – it is not close to a consumer product. If you are a visionary developer, a dreamer, or someone who thinks about how we will experience the world in the near-future, this is a device worth owning and working with. If you’re a consumer who must have the new new thing, this is for you (for the bragging rights, conversation piece, fashion accessory, etc.). If you are a normal person who just wants stuff to work, don’t even think about purchasing one – just find a friend who owns one and go mess around with it."

But Zuck’s bravado is unflatteringly being compared to the overly hasty obituary for the iPhone written by rival Steve Ballmer when the revolutionary device first launched nearly 17 years ago.

tnn_tech,2024-02-16,11,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ZqDeLsZW5/,"Apple เอาไงต่อ เมื่อแฟน ๆ บางส่วนเริ่มส่งคืน Vision Pro แล้ว
.
บริษัทแอปเปิล (Apple) มีนโยบายส่งคืนสินค้าได้ หากไม่พึงพอใจผลิตภัณฑ์ภายใน 14 วัน และล่าสุดในช่วงไม่กี่วันมานี้ เจ้าของชุดหูฟัง (Headset) อย่างวิชัน โปร (Vision Pro) กำลังถูกส่งคืนชุดหูฟังนี้ให้แอปเปิลจากผู้ใช้หลายคน

หนึ่งในเหตุผลหลักที่ทำให้ผู้ใช้หลายรายส่ง Vision Pro คืนแอปเปิลก็คือเรื่องของน้ำหนักที่มากพอสมควร และน้ำหนักส่วนใหญ่ก็เทไปด้านหน้า มันทำให้ผู้ใช้ปวดหัว และทำให้รู้สึกเหมือนเมารถ ผู้ใช้หลายรายบอกว่า Vision Pro ทำให้เกิดรอยแดงหรือตาแห้งด้วย

ปาร์คเกอร์ ออร์โตลานี่ (Parker Ortolani) ผู้จัดการผลิตภัณฑ์ของสื่อเดอะเวิร์จ (The Verge) และเป็นหนึ่งในผู้ใช้ แสดงความเห็นว่า “Vision Pro สามารถใช้งานได้อย่างน่ามหัศจรรย์อย่างที่ผมหวังเลย แต่การสวมใส่มันทำให้ผมอึดอัดแม้จะใส่ในช่วงสั้น ๆ ทั้งจากน้ำหนักของมันและการออกแบบสายรัด ผมอยากใช้มันนะ แต่ไม่ค่อยกล้าใส่เท่าไหร่ อีกทั้งมันยังแพงเกินไปและเทอะทะเกินกว่าที่จะพยายามทำความคุ้นเคยกับอาการปวดหัวและปวดตา แต่ผมจะกลับมาลองใช้มันใหม่ในรุ่นถัดไปนะ”

นอกจากปัญหาเรื่องตัวผลิตภัณฑ์แล้ว อีกหนึ่งในเหตุผลที่ผู้ใช้หลายคนอ้างสำหรับการส่ง Vision Pro คืน ก็คือมันไม่ได้ช่วยให้พวกเขาทำงานได้เยอะขึ้นเมื่อเทียบกับราคา ผู้ใช้รายหนึ่งบอกว่า การสวม Vision Pro และใช้โปรแกรมฟิกมา ทำให้เขารู้สึกเวียนหัว ส่วนวิศวกรอีกคนบอกว่ามีปัญหาเรื่องการโฟกัส ทำให้เขาปวดหัว ส่วนผู้ใช้อีกคนก็บอกว่า “ถ้าผมไม่ได้ใช้ Vision Pro เพื่อทำงาน และถ้าผมไม่ชอบที่จะใช้มันเพื่อความบันเทิง อีกทั้งไม่มีเกมมากพอให้เล่นกับ Vision Pro ผมก็ไม่รู้จะเก็บมันไว้ทำไม”

แต่ทั้งนี้ ก็ไม่สามารถตัดสิน Vision Pro ด้วยมุมมองการใช้งานจากผู้ใช้ที่กล่าวถึงข้างต้นได้ โดยผู้ใช้บางคนก็บอกว่าแม้จะคืน Vision Pro แต่หากมันมีรุ่นที่ 2 ออกมา พวกเขาก็อยากลองใช้อีกรอบ บางส่วนก็เน้นย้ำว่า ตัวเทคโนโลยีไม่ได้มีปัญหา ส่วนที่มีปัญหาคือใช้งานไม่สบาย รวมถึงยังไม่มีตัวแอปพลิเคชันชูโรงที่จะทำให้ใช้ Vision Pro ต่อ

อย่างไรก็ตาม แม้จะมีมุมมองเช่นนี้ออกมา แต่ยังไม่ทราบถึงอัตราผลตอบแทนที่แท้จริงหรือความคาดหวังภายในของ Apple ที่มีต่อ Vision Pro ทั้งนี้ก็ต้องรอดูท่าทีของแอปเปิลต่อเรื่องนี้ ว่าจะออกมาแก้เกมอย่างไร รวมถึงจะพัฒนาปรับปรุงด้านไหนเพิ่มเติมในอนาคต

Zuckerberg says the Meta Quest 3 “is the better product, period,” compared to the Vision Pro.⁠
⁠
Now, we expect Zuck to think that way. But ZDNET had to put the two headsets head-to-head (no pun intended) and either support or debunk Zuckerberg’s claims.⁠
⁠
ZDNET’s June Wan has spent some time with both headsets and compared their capabilities and use cases to help you decide which is best. ⁠

internationalbusinessmag,2024-02-16,0,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3aRuLAM0DX/,"Mark Zuckerberg dunked on Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro-and it's giving critics an acute case of déjà vu.

In an Instagram post this week, the Meta founder on Tuesday dismissed the premium mixed reality headset as inferior to his own Quest 3 mixed reality headset both in price and performance, calling the latter the ""better product, period.""

But Zuck's bravado is unflatteringly being compared to the overly hasty obituary for the iPhone written by rival Steve Ballmer when the revolutionary device first launched nearly 17 years ago.

""There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,"" the ex-Microsoft CEO famously predicted in 2007 in a quote that has since aged very poorly.

Ever since its launch, several people have been documenting their experience of using Apple’s newest breakthrough. 

However, the excitement seems to be fading now as many users are returning their headsets after complaining of headaches and motion sickness.

Some users also complained of dry eyes and redness in their eyes due to the constant exposure to light. 

The weight of the device, and the fact that most of it is 
front-loaded, has been another complaint. Some even fear that the device may cause a burst blood vessel in the eye.

Actually probably returning it because it hurts my damn face too much. My face was sore and red for almost a day after my first use. Really cool tech though, but hard to find too many use cases that made having a heavy device in my head worth it. Definitely loved playing my PC games in it on an insanely huge screen, studying chess, crocheting and just the Apple ecosystem. Movies/TV was pretty insane, but I don’t watch enough to justify.  @metaquest 3 is where it’s at for me still. So much more comfortable and so many fun multiplayer games that make me happy.

The day was September 3rd 2020 when the California based company Apple lost a staggering $180 billion in one day. The company currently has an astonishing value of $2.86 trillion so that would mean Apple lost approximately six percent of it’s entire value in one day.

However, despite enduring what could be considered one of its worst fiscal setbacks, Apple managed to rebound throughout the year. By January 2021, the company had made a remarkable recovery, finishing the year with a 65 percent increase in market value.

With the release of new and groundbreaking products such as the iPhone 15 and more notably the Apple Vision Pro headset which has taken the world and social media alight due to it’s futuristic concept that has potential to begin a new era not only for Apple but for the technology sector as a whole, it is fair to say that Apple have gone from strength to strength since their abysmal day in 2020.

kicksology,2024-02-16,100,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3bAlmxvs2R/,"Jo & I had a chance to experience Apple Vision Pro demos last week. My thoughts on the device changed quite a bit after the demo—they’re too long to share here, but check out the latest episode of Learn, Make, Learn if you’re interested (link in bio).

A few quick notes:
The strong Han Solo vibes were not intentional!

For some reason, I looked like I was doing something vaguely inappropriate in almost all of my photos (as evidenced by the 2nd photo), but I swear I wasn’t!😅

In a nice bit of retail theater, after an initial measurement process that’s done via the Apple Store app on your own iPhone, a staffer in the back of the store configures the AVP—inc. inserting corrective lenses if you wear glasses—and brings it out to you on a beautiful, custom designed tray (3rd photo).

And, speaking of glasses, they have a device in the store that can determine your prescription, so glasses-wearers need only bring them with you—no need to dig up your prescription info.

I was fine with the “Solo Knit” band that’s shown in most of the promo shots, but Jo wasn’t able to get a comfortable fit with it. Fortunately, the person leading Jo’s demo offered her the option to swap over to the “Dual Loop” band that also comes with the AVP and, while it still wasn’t perfect, it provided her with a much better overall fit (photos 5 - 7).

We’re both sensitive to motion sickness and, while neither of us experienced it during our demos, we both felt a bit of it afterwards. I “think” this may have been in part due to the nature of the demo experience, which ends with a very cool reel of immersive videos that features more quick-cutting than you’d likely encounter in day-to-day use.

Speaking of which, the immersive videos are pretty remarkable—far, far better than conventional 3-D video.

Even if you have no intention of buying one, if you have any interest in tech or retail, I think it’s worth booking a demo (via Apple’s Web site or the Apple Store app). They’re free, and the staffers are not at all pushy about buying. We’re both glad we gave it a go!

At @aww.tokyo we quite literally, aim to change the world with virtual humans. 
When we say it, we actually mean it. 

I want to take some time to share our thoughts on our latest work.
imma, alongside stars like Lil Nas X, Camila Mendes, Youngji Lee, Kōki, and Wu Jinyan, is featured in one of @coach ‘s biggest campaign yet. 

We’re a company creating virtual humans and virtual worlds - but what we believe in, above anything, is the potential of human power, and how that potential can be amplified by the power of “virtual” - which we believe is just another word for the human “imagination”. 

Through this campaign, and everything we do, we always aim to bridge the gap between virtual and physical worlds. 

The virtual world isn’t as far away as you may think. How we communicate to each other, how we see the world, how we take in information: basically how we perceive reality has changed and will keep on changing cohesive to virtual updates. From the recent release of Apple Vision Pro and today’s news about OpenAI’s Sora, we know that the virtual world will further become our mundane. 

In such a future, we want to create meaning. We want to share personal human stories. We want to connect beyond our physical limits. At Aww, we believe that virtual humans are the key in unlocking the potential of humanity. We started our Virtual Human Live Streaming Project ANOME last year, which focused on empowering people with virtual human alternative egos. We’re just getting started. What’s next?

無睇Game of Thrones，不過聽講唔少人慕名而來呢個位於赫羅納（Girona）嘅拍攝場景，鐘意影建築嘅話，Girona Cathedral 應該用嚟影Spatial photos，將來再用Vision Pro之類嘅Gadget睇返應該都好震撼下。

Haven't watched Game of Thrones, but I've heard many come to this location in Girona for its fame. For those who adore architectural photography, Girona Cathedral is a prime spot for capturing spatial photos. Revisiting these shots with gadgets like Vision Pro would surely offer a stunning experience.

cablgram,2024-02-17,1704,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3c1AjCKRo0/," Some early adopters of Apple's Vision Pro, a $3,500 headset, are returning their devices as they reach the end of Apple's 14-day return policy. Users cite discomfort, including headaches and motion sickness, as primary reasons for returns. The device's weight and front-loaded design have been particularly problematic, with reports of physical reactions such as burst blood vessels and eye redness, highlighting the challenges of wearable technology comfort and fit for a diverse user base.

👨‍💻 Apart from physical discomfort, the Vision Pro has faced criticism for not meeting productivity or entertainment expectations relative to its high cost. Users have reported difficulties in using the device for work-related tasks, such as coding and designing, due to focusing issues and dizziness. The lack of adequate support for various file types and multitasking inefficiencies further detracts from its value as a productivity tool, despite its advanced technology.

👉 Despite these challenges, some users remain hopeful for future iterations of the Vision Pro, emphasizing the potential for improvement in comfort and functionality. The feedback from this vocal subset of customers underscores the importance of addressing user experience and application relevance in wearable tech, even as it remains unclear how widespread these issues are or what impact they may have on the Vision Pro's long-term success.

gcprifleco,2024-02-17,1349,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3dXO6Wslea/,"I want to go through some of the new features on the @visionprc PRO chassis. 

From back to front:
All adjustments on the buttstock has a new reinforced sliding track to prevent them from coming  out and to provide a smooth and solid touch to it while you’re doing your adjustments. You can also lock your hight adjustments on the buttpad through a small hole right underneath the ""V"" logo and you can add weights in the buttstock aswell. 

Not only has the thumb rest gotten a new and more rugged design, but you now have twice as many holes to place it in and it also got a 
elongated attachment hole to really fine tune the right position for your hand. 
The Vision PRO chassis is compatible for both right and left handed shooters. There is a little plate you easily can remove and move over to the opposite side depending on if you’re right or left handed. 
You have both hight and length adjustments for your magazine to make sure it fit’s and feed’s perfect!
There is also three holes on each side of the center base of the chassis for accessories like spare round holders, dope or levels. 

The forend got RRS lock and V-Lock (Vision Lock). The V-Lock is filled up with something called ""Sticky bars"", these gives you more grip on your pillow or barricade.
There can also be added a full top cover on the forend if you like that and they have Picatinny rails that is compatible with it if you like to run a night vision. 
 
This is some of the new major features on the chassis, but this is not everything. If you would like a more detailed review of the chassis, Vision has uploaded a great video on their YouTube channel! You can also find it on mine."

chatgptmastery,2024-02-17,28,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3dWfeYNnrt/,"Brilliant Labs has unveiled Frame, a sleek pair of AR glasses featuring the versatile AI assistant, Noa. Unlike the bulkier Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality offerings from competitors like Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest 3, Frame adopts a more traditional eyewear aesthetic. This design choice emphasizes staying connected with the real world rather than immersing users in a digital one. Frame facilitates interaction with your surroundings using a camera and voice commands.

Noa, the embedded AI assistant, responds to user inquiries by displaying text responses directly on the glasses’ lenses. Beyond voice interaction, Noa is equipped to analyze visual inputs, create images, and translate languages. This functionality is powered by a combination of advanced AI technologies, including Perplexity’s AI conversational search engine, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion for text-to-image tasks, OpenAI’s GPT4 for text generation, and the Whisper speech recognition system.

Brilliant Labs has democratized the future with Frame, pricing this next evolution of human-tool interaction at an accessible $349. Pre-orders are a testament to a world ready to step into the future, starting April 15th, 2024

If you are an iPhone user, you just got slapped with a 30% tax on Instagram boosted posts. 🤦‍♂️

Apple has let Meta’s in-app purchases 30/70 split slide for a long time, but now they are enforcing it. 

By the end of Februray, if you own an iPhone and boost your posts (in app) you will be wacked with a nearly 1/3 increase is cost. 🤯

My theory: I believe Meta is doing this to pull revenue away from Meta (now that they are direct competitors with the Quest and Vision Pro VR/AR headset goggles. 

Anyways…how can you avoid paying extra? 👇

1️⃣ Go to: https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite.

2️⃣ Set up your campaign

3️⃣ Launch your boosted posts from desktop. 

Save this and share this with a friend to save them THOUSANDS! 💸

PS: We are not sure if this 30% “tax” will apply to Meta-Verified yet (will keep you posted).

The new Apple Vision Pro is here.

A mixed-reality headset that's so clear.

It lets you see the world in a new way.

It lets you do more than you can say.

But don't forget the past days.

When we had to use our imagination.

When we had to rely on our dedication.

The future of technology is amazing.

But it can also be distracting and blinding.

Don't lose sight of your true vision.

Don't let tech make you lose your mission.

Great View,

These all came from a prompt I had midjourney help me with way back when the describe feature was released. I asked it to describe the very last image in this carousel (which I created), here’s one way what it described the image: 

a group of pcs are wearing colored t shirts, in the style of surreal robotics, light amber and pink, bold and busy

These are actually all actually created using v5.1 (except the last, that’s v4 early daaaaaays!)

Throwing in a single prompt and using one of the first four images it spits out is one way to work, but not my way. I’m constantly remixing my own work in new ways because it’s so fking fun!!! 

Are you a midjourney mistress too?? Or are you waiting for me to drop a course? Cause it is coming, promise! 

Drop a bot in the comments if you NEEEED that course to come out this quarter! More bots means more dedication to getting it done! 🤖"

📚📚 BOOK REVIEW 📚📚
Artificial Wisdom
Thomas R. Weaver.

I thought when I first started reading this book, in our readalong email request, I was intrigued because it is within a time frame where I would be living so would it be realistic or far fetched like we see in films. When I first started reading the book, I won’t lie, I really struggled with it. It just wasn’t keeping me engaged and there were bits i struggled to keep up with purely because it wasnt engaging with me but then, all of a sudden stuff started happening and found I really couldnt put it down. Everything was clicking into place but things i really didnt expect and then the last few chapters for me through everything I had thought out the window and now im reeling and don’t what to think, who to believe and know where its going. I really hope there is a Book 2 because I need to know more. If you like technology and what our future could be like, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite terrifying that this books seems more and more a reality when you think about it, just look at the apple vision pro that has been released, i feel like this is literally a big part of this book and is now in real life. I think one day this book might be one we look at and think wow we knew all along this was going to happen.

Less VR and more Flappy Bird, according to strategy director at Design Bridge and Partners, Ben Thrasher. 

""It is not shiny new toys like the Vision Pro that have driven the rise of gaming, but the proliferation of the humble smartphone. Without even realising it, most of us have used this device to participate in some form of gaming,"" he writes. 

By itself, the global mobile gaming industry is set to reach $339.45bn by 2030, up from just $108.15bn in 2022. The industry’s growth is particularly stark in nations where mobile adoption is still on a rapid incline.

dollymeckler,2024-02-20,220,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3jY_xYsEGV/,"Had the most incredible demo trying the @apple Vision Pro this afternoon. They fit comfortably, I got the hand/finger gestures down quickly, but they were heavy. It’s hard to explain this unless you’ve tried them, but I actually felt that the experience was rather *emotional* (you can see my teary eyes in my post-Vision Pro glow pic in #3 🥹) in a few ways:

1) The spatial and immersive photos blew my mind. You can share real world experiences with other people - think capturing content at a birthday party or wedding or your child taking their first steps and sharing it with an older grandparent who can’t be there.

2) The immersive environments really transport you and are an escape from reality. They showed me an immersive 360 degree photo of a lake which completely took over my field of vision, and a few minutes later it started raining. As soon as they turned the immersive environment off, I snapped back to reality almost forgetting where I was. It was really trippy, but cool.

3) I hadn’t even thought about real-world applications for this tech, but seeing what a Live Vision Pro sports game could look like or watching a movie on Vision Pro opens up a whole new world for businesses.

4) Trying these Vision Pros first-hand really felt like the future is here. We are living it! I love that and think that’s so cool. This is some Space Odyssey type stuff that we are lucky enough to witness before our very own eyes (no pun intended).

This all opens up a whole new world of creativity and that felt inspiring to me. I would encourage you to go try them for yourself! But beware of Vision Pro forehead (swipe to the end to see what I mean)"

Apple’s longest-serving product designer has retired, and the company is advancing its generative AI efforts.

Apple is likely 18 months away from releasing a second-generation Vision Pro, considering feedback on the current version. Despite positive reviews and impressive demos, users find the headset cumbersome and lacking practicality for daily use. Returns, while not alarming, are higher than usual for Apple products, indicating even loyal customers have reservations. Apple is gathering feedback to improve the device, with concerns ranging from weight and discomfort to the lack of compelling applications justifying the high price tag.

จุดเด่น ของแอป TikTok Vision Pro อยู่ที่การใช้ประโยชน์จากอินเทอร์เฟซของแว่นตา Vision Pro ที่สามารถแสดงผลสิ่งต่าง ๆ บนหน้าจอส่วนอื่น เช่น แสดงหน้าโปรไฟล์ผู้ใช้ ข้อมูลวิดีโอ และคอมเมนต์ โดยไม่บดบังหน้าจอวิดีโอหลักนั้นเอง ฟิลแบบเปิดหลายๆหน้าต่าง.

techxcite,2024-02-20,1,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ktSmduG_5/,"มาอยู่แล้วเจ้านี้!! Huawei เตรียมเปิดตัวแว่น VR Vision Headset ในราคาครึ่งของ Apple Vision Pro เท่านั้น.

รายงานล่าสุดเผยว่า Huawei มีแผนเปิดตัว Vision headset รุ่นใหม่ เพื่อชิงส่วนแบ่งตลาดกับ Apple ในด้านเทคโนโลยี Virtual Reality (VR) ซึ่งยักษ์ใหญ่ด้านเทคโนโลยีจากจีนรายนี้กำลังขยายธุรกิจไปยังหลายเซกเมนต์เลย.

Li Nan อดีตกรรมการฝ่ายการตลาดของ Meizu ได้โพสต์ข้อมูลบน Weibo เกี่ยวกับแว่นตา VR ของ Apple และ Huawei ที่คาดว่าจะเปิดตัวในปีนี้ โดยคาดการณ์ว่า Huawei จะใช้ชื่อรุ่นว่า Vision Pro ( ใช่ครับอ่านไม่ผิด ).

ต้องบอกก่อนว่า Huawei ได้จดทะเบียนเครื่องหมายการค้าชื่อนี้ในประเทศจีนตั้งแต่ปี 2019 ไปแล้วซึ่งครอบคลุมผลิตภัณฑ์หลากหลายประเภท เช่น สมาร์ททีวีและแว่นตา ขณะเดียวกัน ผู้ผลิตเทคโนโลยีจากสหรัฐฯ อาจต้องเปลี่ยนชื่อรุ่นใหม่เมื่อเปิดตัวอุปกรณ์ VR ในประเทศจีนเลยแหละ.

Li Nan ได้อธิบายรายละเอียดเกี่ยวกับตัวสเปคของหน้าจอแว่นตา VR ทั้งสองรุ่น โดย Huawei Vision Pro อาจใช้หน้าจอ Sony micro-OLED 4K พร้อมระบบควบคุมด้วยท่าทางแบบไร้ดีเลย์.

นอกจากนี้ Huawei อาจใช้ชิปเซ็ตของตัวเองในการขับเคลื่อนแว่นตา VR รุ่นใหม่นี้ ซึ่งแตกต่างจาก Apple ที่อาจใช้ชิป R1 และรองรับฟีเจอร์ EyeSight แต่ Vision Pro จะมีน้ำหนักเบากว่าเกือบครึ่ง โดยอยู่ที่ 350 กรัม ในขณะที่ Apple Vision Pro มีน้ำหนัก 600 กรัม.

อีกทั้งราคาของ Vision Pro คาดว่าจะอยู่ที่ 15,000 หยวน ซึ่งถือว่าเป็นครึ่งหนึ่งของราคา Apple Vision Pro อีกด้วย.

I remember connecting to the internet for the very first time, the sound of the dial-up modem buzzing through the room… Downloading an MP3 file on Kazaa, Limewire, or Soulseek… Man, little did we know what was waiting for us in the future… 🥸

I remember holding the iPhone for the very first time… A phone without buttons, WTF?! 🤯 

And last week I’ve experienced an equal experience to add to that list of memorable experiences in my life.

The Apple Vision Pro. 👓 

What an amazing piece of technology! Words can’t describe how it feels to use this thing so I won’t even try… BUT I will tell you this! 

AR, VR, or whatever kind of R is going to change A LOT of things in our world and it’s going to happen FAST.

On the Vision Pro you can attend a jamming studio session with Alicia Keys and once I was done “watching it” I was left with the feeling that I met her. That’s how real the experience felt. 😱

We don’t know where we’re going but I know it’s going to be exciting."

It makes a lot of sense as Tanaki is a noodle, so pushed the curve workflow a lot and feel like he’s really got much more characterful since being hit with a limitation like “no blend shapes”.

💰 Despite its lower price, Zuckerberg suggests that the Quest 3 surpasses the Vision Pro in most aspects including design, comfort, versatility, image quality, input methods, and content library. 

🚀 He draws parallels to past computing generations and champions Meta's open model in the mixed reality space, as exemplified by the Quest series. 

🎯 Zuckerberg ultimately positions the Quest 3 as the superior choice for most users due to its well-rounded capabilities and excellent value.

We’ve been deep diving into Apple Vision Pro’s capabilities these past weeks, and to say we’re impressed would be an understatement.

Apple continues to redefine our connections with technology, and the Vision Pro is no exception.

It’s not just about innovation; it’s about revolutionizing the way we interact with the world.

Trifork has been a partner of @apple Apple since the introduction of the iPhone. Together we have developed digital products for some of the most successful companies in the world.

Now, with the Vision Pro, we’re starting a new chapter of possibilities for the enterprise.

But what does that mean?

We have been hard at work on the VisionOS for some time, experiencing great customer engagement along the way. It’s clear to us that the introduction of VisionOS into the enterprise sphere is set to accelerate a transformative shift across various operational dimensions.

At Trifork, our mission has always been to change the world with software. With Apple Vision Pro, we’re unlocking new doors for our clients and the community at large.

It was definitely an interesting experience with my eyes being the way that they are. There will be a future generation of this product that will be a game changer for the visually impaired. 

This is a product that I encourage people to go try and demo so that they can experience what could be coming down the pipeline later this decade, I also think it's important to encourage people to start thinking about the social impacts of something like this could be as well.

Apple’s $3500 face computer is here, and after spending far too many hours inside it, Ed Zitron has found Apple’s vision of the future to be equal parts exciting and frustrating - and a dark omen for the future of tech. He also sits down with the Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern to talk about her experience as one of the early reviewers of the Vision Pro."

⁠
In Jason’s review of the Apple Vision Pro, Jason talks about the Vision Pro’s best features, along with what he thinks Apple can improve. Jason acknowledges that the Vision Pro is a testament to technological and engineering innovation, but there’s always room for improvement.⁠

jonworrel,2024-02-21,8,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3mhu8VA5DP/,"This weekend I went to the Apple Store and got a demo of the Apple Vision Pro spatial computing headset.

This is @apple’s first spatial computing device, its formal entry into the headset market and its first new major product category since the Apple Watch.

My initial impressions were mostly positive and I was impressed by the commendable immersion level, relatively comfortable design, ease of use and accuracy of the eye and hand guesture tracking technology. On the other hand, I think the ergonomics of the design need and have room for improvement, as well as battery life, resolution and image accuracy, portability, price point and user safety.

Spatial computing is here to stay and the seamless nature of eye and hand gesture tracking is only going to get better and more efficient with time.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Venture Bytes is a monthly insight report from Manhattan Venture Research.  As with all our Venture Bytes, this edition has two lead articles in addition to our takes on topical news items, selected funding rounds, and exits. The report rounds out with selected private and public valuations, and a Liquidity Watchlist, which is a proprietary list of top 25 promising private companies in the TMT space that are candidates for a liquidity event – either an IPO or a merger - within the next 12 to 18 months.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The two lead articles in this edition are on the growing importance of LLM orchestrators in the Generative AI space and on the Extended Reality Space, which got a much-needed boost with Apple’s launch of Vision Pro, respectively. Generative AI has become a competitive and operational imperative for businesses, but companies struggle with scale, production, and expertise. Addressing these challenges and improving AI workflows requires combining several AI models, algorithms, and tools into a single framework. Orchestration startups span a broad spectrum, offering services from model refinement to application rollout and computational acceleration. Additionally, LLM orchestration start-ups help businesses by selecting optimal models, fine-tuning, unifying various LLMs into integrated services, and deploying applications in a cost-efficient manner. Key start-ups include Anyscale, Run.ai, and Pinecone.

“A video making its rounds online shows our patrol team in Central Division ‘face-to-face’ with the future — a pedestrian donning the latest Apple Vision Pro headset while walking in the street downtown,” the department said in a post on its Instagram page. “It was a sight that had us pausing in bewilderment. While we’re all for exploring new dimensions and technology, let’s remember the importance of pedestrian safety.”

The statement continued: “Keep those virtual experiences on the sidewalk, folks, and let’s cross streets the old-fashioned way — with our eyes wide open to the real world, unobstructed and without distractions!”

The “spatial computer” from Apple blends 3D digital content with the physical world, and has several uses for health care organizations, from the management of patient information to training and assisting in procedures.

To capitalize on the benefits of spatial computing in health care, Sharp has announced the creation of the Spatial Computing Center of Excellence.

toronto.culture,2024-02-22,428,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3p3ZOhMDZV/,"Nielsen today released its January report on viewing usage across linear TV and streaming, which revealed that YouTube is once again the overall top streaming service in the U.S., with 8.6% of viewing on television screens. Netflix, meanwhile, saw 7.9% of TV usage. The new data points to YouTube’s dominance in the TV streaming arena and marks 12 consecutive months of the platform being in the top spot.

In a blog post celebrating the achievement, the Google-owned streaming service announced that viewers now watch a daily average of over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on their televisions, which could indicate that there’s a preference for user-generated videos among U.S. consumers rather than traditional TV shows. Sixty-one percent of Gen Z reported that they favor user-generated content over other content formats.

Plus, creators are seeing an increase in viewership come from TVs. According to the company, the number of top YouTubers that receive the most watch time on TVs has sky-rocketed by more than 400%. HopeScope, a creator who reviews viral products, notably saw a 172% jump in TV watch time in 2023. This could be good news for family-friendly YouTubers who have to compete with TikTok for kids’ attention. Children ages 4 through 18 spent a global average of 112 minutes daily on TikTok in 2023, per a recent study.

Although YouTube may have precedence in the living room, TikTok continues to dominate on mobile devices. The short-form video app recently began testing the ability for TikTokers to upload 30-minute videos, which could step on YouTube’s toes. TikTok also entered the spatial reality space, launching a native app on the Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, YouTube decided to not build a dedicated app for the device.
YouTube has reached a few other milestones in recent months, including the 100 million users who pay for YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. Additionally, YouTube TV now has more than 8 million subscribers and YouTube Shorts recently achieved over 70 billion daily views.

Occlusion - Ensures objects block one thing from the other, like they do in real life. When you put your hand up, you don’t see anything behind your hand, it’s “occluded” from what’s behind it. It’s the feature that makes the virtual world feel as layered as your actual eyesight.

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me - I’m dashing to catch my departure northward to Canada, savoring my final sip before boarding the train. Amidst the anticipation of a demanding business weekend and unraveling new projections, I’m surrounded by life’s unfolding tales. At a nearby table, a young family bubbles with excitement, on the cusp of sharing their joy of expecting a second child with the in-laws. Across the way, two lovers are entwined in a playful debate of affection over café espressos, their laughter mingling with shared kisses. Meanwhile, a clandestine meet unfolds at the bar, a mistress glances at the door, awaiting her moment of secret romance. Not far off, a businessman pores over the latest market trends, dreams of a Porsche 911 Turbo coloring his thoughts. And amidst it all, a kid marvels at his latest tech treasure, lost in the wonder of a new iPhone set Vision Pro. Each person, each story, a truth to the vibrant weave of life. So much happening, so much to observe – but therein lies the allure. Every soul has a narrative, a unique journey through the bustling corridors of existence.

They’re also dazzled by the Apple Vision Pro’s support for a rare film aspect ratio, suggesting it could make even your home videos look like cinematic masterpieces.

I’m talking sick graphics (and I’m not using sick as a doctor would here) in an incredibly immersive experience.

For those of you who have read Ready, Player, One, this is our first foray into our own Oasis. But let’s not forget the message of the novel. Nor the real-life consequences that this has.

We can choose to take on innovation, full speed ahead. Or we can choose to take it on gradually. Cautiously. Putting all of the brakes in place so that we are at least somewhat protected.

Needless to say, I chose not to take one of these bad boys home with me on this trip. At this point in time, I feel like it introduces just one more potential addiction into my life, which I just can’t afford. Not in the financial sense, of course, but in the life kind. 

I know we’re all headed that way anyway. In a number of years, we’ll all be wearing these on our heads. Maybe sooner rather than later. Are we ready for it, player one?"

As videos emerge of people in Apple Vision Pro goggles walking and waving through town, it's tempting to despair. But @nataliedunno’s piece, on finding surprising solace in the virtual landscapes of Red Dead Redemption 2 after a debilitating injury, may offer hope.

For @noemamag, @henrywismayer explores how capitalism has twisted touristic ideals of democracy, curiosity, and self-improvement into a bonanza of aesthetic performance and commercial pseudo-places. A must read if you're interested in the value and ethics of travel.

Will humans (well, some scientists) be fully aquatic by 2027? If Bristol-based company DEEP (@unumsumusmare) is to be believed, yes. Nane Steinhoff explores for @oceano_mag

Is the death of snowsports partly a state of mind? Friend of AU @neonstash’s new film Thrawn, with @lesleymckenna, is a fun caper of Scottish lines ridden with powerful enthusiasm – and an exhibition of the abundance mindset required for anything approaching a degrowth future.

designed2invest,2024-02-24,11,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3vX_LAvYCH/,"Apple’s Vision Pro VR headset offers immersive experiences, featuring high-resolution graphics and intuitive controls through eye and hand gestures. Priced at $3,499, it provides a glimpse into the future of computing. Additional accessories can push the total cost to $4,500.

The Vision Pro boasts a sophisticated array of components, with its primary processor ranking as the second most costly part. This central processor integrates Apple’s powerful M2 chip, a component renowned for its performance in the MacBook Air, alongside the R1 chip. The latter, a custom-designed processor, efficiently manages video feeds and other sensory data collected by the device.

Apple’s adoption of display technologies tends to drive down prices as these technologies become more mainstream and competition among suppliers intensifies. Notably, South Korean giants like Samsung Display and LG Display, alongside Chinese firms like Seeya and BOE, are entering the market with OLED on silicon products. Analysts anticipate a decrease in costs for Vision Pro’s specialized screens in the foreseeable future.

While Apple refrains from commenting on cost estimates and teardowns, CEO Tim Cook has expressed skepticism regarding their accuracy. Nonetheless, during an earnings call, Cook underscored the remarkable technological sophistication of the Vision Pro, highlighting the substantial investment in research and development. He emphasized the product’s foundation built upon thousands of patents, years of innovation spanning silicon to displays, and significant advancements in AI and machine learning, which power features like hand tracking and room mapping.

alericheck,2024-02-24,47,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3vyrvyxCRs/,"The Apple Vision Pro is Pretty Remarkable! (My Thoughts Below)

Honestly, it reminds me of the early iPhone, Apple Watch Gen 1, etc. -- First Gen Tech that, while not fully polished yet, gives you a massive glimpse into what is to come in the future! 💯

I've always been someone who loves trying out the latest tech when it first comes out -- harkening back to my days creating a 500k+ Subscriber Tech Review YouTube Channel, AppFind.

What I feel when I use my Apple Vision Pro is the same thing I felt in the early days of the iPhone & Apple Watch -- the sense of POSSIBILITY as to what is coming next.

There's not a lot of apps yet for the Vision Pro, it's a bit heavy on the head & battery life is low -- but the underlying technology is incredibly innovative & I can see how this has the ability to become a desktop replacement -- creating a massive virtual screen you can use to get work done!

And that's before you dive into the AR / VR possibilities with custom apps that are out & will be released in the coming years.

I think Augmented Reality is going to change the way we use & interface with computers long-term -- the ability to have spatial computing with numerous screens & tabs all in front of you is a clear peak at what the future may have in store!

What are your thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro?"

thebananaspodcast,2024-02-24,585,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3vgPsUP4fe/,"FUTURISM - Earlier this week, a wildly 2024 photo came across our desk: an image of a young bride standing with her groom, who's donned one of Apple's new Vision Pro headsets for their big day. The groom is notably smiling; the bride, meanwhile, looks a little less than pleased.

Did he wear the roughly $3,500 spatial computing headset during the ceremony? Did he dream of one day strapping a 1.3-pound VR device to his face on his wedding day? And how did the bride really feel about it?

To find out, we got in touch with the newlyweds. And we can confirm that the headset was only donned after the ceremony.

""I did not wear it in ceremony out of respect to God and to my wife,"" the groom, a 24-year-old software developer and serial entrepreneur named Jacob Wright, said on a Wednesday phone call. ""But after we got out [of the ceremony], we were taking photos — like the bridesmaids and the groomsmen and things — and just jokingly, I was like, 'Hey, I have my Apple Vision Pro in my backpack.""

""I carry my backpack everywhere,"" he added, sheepishly. ""It's a bad habit."" So, the Utah-based developer said he ran back to the car to grab the headset mid-photoshoot.

""My wife was like, 'We're not taking photos in the Vision Pro,"" he added. ""But I told her it was just for the meme."" (He also confirmed that no, he didn't exactly grow up envisioning himself wearing a face computer at his nuptials.) 

""He's like, 'Can we please take pictures?'"" said Cambree, a full-time student at Brigham Young University. ""So I was like, 'Yeah, it's fine if everyone else leaves.' But it was the last thing I wanted pictures of.""

""I look pissed in the picture. I wasn't really mad, though,"" she added. ""I just thought it was funny.""

By wearing the headset, Jacob realized he could capture an immersive memory for the couple and, maybe one day, their family to look back on.

""I have a video of me there with all the bridesmaids, all the groomsmen — everyone who came to the ceremony,"" Jacob beamed. ""I think that'll be super awesome to show our kids in 20 years,"" he continued, hypothesizing that perhaps, at that point, they'll be able to view the memory as ""a hologram or something?""

Separately, several Vision Pro owners are reporting near-identical vertical hairline cracks forming on the glass inexplicably above the nose bridge area. Theories include potential overheating when charging in the case or with the soft cover on. The root cause and scale of this cracking issue remains unclear.

Previously, users could access TikTok videos through their web browser on the Vision Pro, but the new native app offers a more engaging viewing experience.

In this version of the TikTok app for Vision Pro, the navigation bar and like button have been relocated off-screen to maximize the video viewing area. Meanwhile, the comment section and creator profiles are accessible as side expansions within the feed.

The app enables users to watch TikTok videos in immersive settings, such as Yosemite or even on the moon. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with the device’s Shared Space feature, allowing users to watch TikTok videos while using other applications.

Brooks is an athlete, entrepreneur, and founder of Earthy, a company revolutionizing sustainable energy for athletes. 

Brooks is currently in the midst of raising capital for his company, and until he hits his goal, he’s doing a marathon a day... He was on day 88 when I spoke to him. Some days have been around LA, others in the Apple Vision Pro or on a treadmill in the back of a van while his wife drives (yes, he’s insane). 

A lot of our conversation centers around this incredible feat; he shares all sorts of tales from this challenge and the ways in which it’s tested and grown him. 

Brooks has also run from Canada to Mexico and is currently preparing for “The Speed Project,” one of the most exciting events where people run from LA to Las Vegas. 

Today’s conversation was an absolute blast; I enjoyed talking with Brooks and chopping it up on his journey through life and this current chapter. This is a really fun conversation that is perfect for your next run or adventure.

Immersive: Panoramic view literally puts you inside photographs and cinema. Tested Blade Runner 2049 in 3D 😳 🤯 

Intuitive: Granted, I had @byrongm giving me live instructions, but I found being able to make commands through your eyes and finger tips to be both incredibly innovative and instinctual.

Vivid: The micro OLED display makes the resolution very life like.

Great version 1.0 which will continue to become more streamlined and lightweight in the years to come…as the team at Apple has always proven.

wired,2024-02-26,554,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ycI9bPvjM/,"In the three or so weeks it has spent on the faces of eager buyers, the Apple Vision Pro has been subjected to its share of criticism. Some customers are making a show of returning their Vision Pro headsets before Apple's standard 14-day return window on new purchases closes. Others have lodged complaints across social media, saying that wearing the Vision Pro for extended periods of time causes great discomfort. 

Ironically, it's Apple's trademark dedication to products with slick aesthetics that's partly to blame. The premium materials that make up the headset–primarily the aluminum chassis and glass optics–are much heavier than the plastic and other lightweight components found in competing mixed-reality headsets. There's also an external battery pack that reduces the headset's portability. 

The bulk, weight, and awkwardness of wearing a computer on your face make for a clunky experience which hardly seems to lend itself to the types of activities Apple is suggesting Vision Pro owners use it for. Some experts believe Apple did this intentionally, aiming to sell to developers rather than regular consumers.

bigyahu,2024-02-26,44,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3zKfyHv5Id/,"Thanks to Contxtual and @oliverw for letting me try his Apple Vision Pro headset! He’s let me try every other headset since VR, AR and spatial computing became a thing, and I can confirm: sometimes you have to wait for the Apple version of a new technology to begin to appreciate the full potential of what this tech might mean in the future. 

Even as a v1.0 this was the first headset I’d consider wearing and using every day (if I could justify the cost, and obviously that will come down.) It felt intuitive, simple and very high quality. Most importantly, as Ollie puts it, Apple’s coming from the opposite direction to Meta and other vendors, which have the virtual experience front and centre and mixed reality as a sometimes-on experience. In the Vision Pro, mixed reality objects are things you choose to add to the real environment you’re in by default. Also, the Vision Pro doesn’t need any kind of accessory like a joystick or wand - it just needs your hand and finger gestures to do everything (though it’ll pair with your external keyboard and mouse, or with your Mac too).

💻NVDA is now worth more than $2 Trillion (yes thats with a big fat T). 

By now, you would have heard its 16% price jump after a stellar earnings. Net income grew more than 400% YoY while its debt dropped 13% YoY. (Pete’s view: If there is one thing that I learnt in decades of investing, while NVDA has amazing promise with the AI growth, this level of growth is not sustainable. While I hold NVDA, this is not a price I will add more. Instead, I will be focusing on other semicon companies where the valuation maybe more reasonable such as AMD, LMRX, AVGO etc. Remember, rising tide floats all boats 🛳)

🛍MercadoLibre shed 10% after disappointing earnings. While earnings grew from $322m to $572m, however market was expecting $678m. (Pete’s view: MELI still show much growth, its revenue has been growing well above 40% on average and its userbase has been growing over 20%. Still a good company in my view)

🍎 Apple just unveiled Apple Sports, an app that provide real time scores and numbers for a range of sports. This is Apple’s push towards its Services and improving the user experience with all these personalisation. (Pete’s view: I think Vision Pro just gave us a glimpse into future of tech personalisation and I agree that Services will be a big part.)

📌Reddit files for IPO under the ticker symbol RDDT and its top executives are paid in hundreds of millions. And thats all we need to know. 😄

🧐Google pull back its AI engine Gemini after it created historically inaccurate pictures. (Pete’s view: Expect Google shares to drop on this. Frankly I am happy. New tech always has problems. This could be a good opportunity)

The scrapped effort, codenamed “Project Titan,” was intended to help Apple compete with Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors, but quickly became little more than an expensive pipe dream for the company.

Apple announced the end of “Project Titan” internally on Tuesday, surprising the roughly 2,000 employees actively at work in the secretive Special Projects Group. According to Bloomberg, many of the staffers will be switched over to Apple’s generative AI division or help to develop new versions of the Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headsets.

“Apple canceling this project is a sigh of relief for us,” said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Apple shareholder Synovus Trust. “When you looked at Apple’s future initiatives, the car project was always the most far-fetched for Apple. This just isn’t in their wheelhouse.”

raphousetv.reloaded,2024-02-28,289,https://www.instagram.com/p/C34g3rDK-Rf/,"Apple will wind down its team working on electric cars, called Special Projects Group, according to Bloomberg.

The news signals an end to Apple’s secretive effort to build a car to rival Tesla. The program employed thousands of employees but never fit with Apple’s core business of electronics and online services, and raised questions about where Apple would turn for the manufacturing of a vehicle.

Reports of Apple’s ambition to build a car first surfaced in 2014 after the company recruited automotive engineers and other talent from auto companies. While there was little public information about Apple’s plans, the company operated a program with autonomous Apple-owned cars equipped with sensors and safety drivers cruising around the San Francisco Bay Area.

Apple’s Special Projects Group had several reorganizations over the years, including layoffs in 2019, when employees were moved to different parts of the company. Some Apple employees in the car division may move to a generative artificial intelligence team, according to Bloomberg.

The company has other automotive-related projects, including its infotainment CarPlay software, which Apple says is installed on 80% of new vehicles.

Apple’s car project was part of an internal effort to look for technologies the company could develop with huge potential markets. Apple continues to develop health technologies, especially for the Apple Watch. And last month, the company released its first virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro.

As part of its silence, Apple’s hasn’t outlined its expenditures in the auto space. Overall, the company spent about $30 billion on research and development in 2023, a 14% increase over the prior year. Apple’s R&D budget includes investments in new software and features for its existing products such as the iPhone.

It takes immense courage to say no.

Even...

...after investing billions in a project.
...after nearly a decade of relentless effort.
...after the world expects you to deliver.

The sunk cost fallacy is a dangerous trap.

Apple's reputation is built on saying ""no"" far more often than ""yes"". I suspect their goal wasn't simply to compete with Tesla (though they likely could). Their ambition was to reinvent the entire car industry. Realizing that factors outside their control hinder them from achieving this industry-shaking vision is exactly the kind of leadership the company is known for. 

Most of Apple's products are industry-defining:

Mac --> Personal Computing
iPod --> Music
iPhone --> Smartphones
iPad --> Tablets
Apple Watch --> Smartwatches
AirPods --> Wearables/Headphones
Vision Pro --> Mixed Reality aka Spatial Computing?

But not all:

HomePod --> An also-ran
Apple TV --> IMO still the best product in its category but not an industry-shaker

A car would have obviously been an entirely different level of commitment and had to be industry-shaking. Anything less would not have been very Apple-like, especially considering cars are not exactly adjacent to Apple's core business.

So while I am personally disappointed at the news, Apple also earned more respect from me with the move.

Apple started working on its multibillion-dollar electric car project named ‘Titan’ back in 2014,

However, after a decade of development, they abruptly canceled it.

Why the sudden stop? 

The slowing market of EVs!! 

Recently, mainstream buyers are shifting their focus from all-electric vehicles due to high prices and a lack of charging infrastructure.

And Apple’s potential vehicle is still years away from its launch.

Zooming ahead, Apple is shifting its focus towards the AI & Vision Pro, the new happening spot in town! 

They are also transferring many employees from the electric car division to the generative AI division

👉 Comfort is a major reason for returns, with complaints of headaches and motion sickness due to the front-heavy weight of the device. Some users have reported physical discomfort, such as burst blood vessels in the eye. 

🤑 Additionally, users find the device too expensive and unwieldy, with limited productivity use cases relative to the price. 

💥 There are also complaints about the device's design and its compatibility with certain file types and multitasking features.

🎯 It remains unclear how this feedback from early adopters will impact the future of the Vision Pro, as some express interest in trying a second-generation model, while others highlight the need for improvements in comfort and functionality.

businessinsiderssa,2024-02-28,152,https://www.instagram.com/p/C35PHNxiepk/,"The zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) era was in its heyday; the iPhone 6 was fresh enough not to feel incremental to consumers, and the problems of a supply chain wrapped up in China only appeared in glimpses.

That all helped afford Apple the luxury to pursue something behind closed doors far beyond its usual remit of personal gadgets.

A decade on, however, things are looking quite different.

So much so, that a Bloomberg report said Apple was calling it quits on its highly secretive EV push known as Project Titan. Senior executives Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch reportedly broke news on Tuesday to the near-2,000 people working on the project.

Historically, Apple has had projects in the background that have never made the light of day. For instance, a tablet prototype developed in 1992 called the PenLite never made it to shelves. Neither did the AirPower, a wireless charging mat announced in 2017.

But in canceling a project that would have taken Apple into an entirely new industry, the company is signaling that it's done with side hobbies. And for good reason.

AI and mixed reality priorities
At an almost $3 trillion market capitalization, and as one of the most cash-rich companies today, it's easy to think Apple has the resources to continue plowing cash into side projects.

But in 2024, it's clear that Apple has a lot of other new areas to throw money at.

Having launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset this month, the company has already committed itself to scaling and commercializing a technology that presents an entirely new business area.

The $3,500 goggles are not expected to be an immediate revenue driver. Still, the company will need to devote serious effort toward innovating the headset over the years, amid user complaints about its weight and comfort.

That's particularly so as competitors like Mark Zuckerberg post public teardowns of Apple's foray into mixed reality — a technology far from hitting mainstream appeal.

Apple will also be thinking hard about AI."

power.ai,2024-02-28,30,https://www.instagram.com/p/C33m8nayWXx/,"🎥 Mark Zuckerberg's recent Instagram video, where he praised Meta Quest 3 over Apple's Vision Pro, garnered significant attention. 

🗣️ In the video, Zuckerberg claimed that after testing both headsets, he found Quest 3 to be superior in most aspects and a better value for users.

💥 Many in the tech community drew comparisons between Zuckerberg's remarks and Steve Ballmer's infamous dismissal of the iPhone. 

👀 Ballmer, then-CEO of Microsoft, famously laughed off the iPhone's launch but later admitted that not taking it seriously was one of his biggest regrets. 

⚡ Some speculate whether Zuckerberg's comments about Vision Pro will have a similar effect in the future.

But could it revolutionize the way music is made? Musician and YouTuber @sanjayc offers his take in a recent review video, and the verdict is… it has potential, but it’s not quite ready for the recording studio.

One of the most appealing features is its screen mirroring, allowing you to project a giant, virtual version of your Mac for easy viewing anywhere in your studio. However, a significant snag for musicians is that Vision Pro gestures can’t interact with the mirrored screen. This means the ease of touch-screen editing on your actual computer is lost, slowing down creative workflow.

lovinmalta,2024-02-29,188,https://www.instagram.com/p/C37nvb6orpF/,"Tech giant Apple has reportedly pulled the plug on its ambitious electric car project, known internally as ""Project Titan."" The decision comes as Apple redirects its efforts towards advancing generative artificial intelligence, a move signalling the company's commitment to innovation in emerging technologies.

The decision to abandon Project Titan was communicated to nearly 2,000 employees on Tuesday, leaving many stunned by the sudden shift in direction.

While some employees will have the opportunity to transition to Apple's Generative AI team, led by John Giannandrea, others may be asked to apply for positions within different divisions of the company. Unfortunately, there have also been signs of layoffs.

Project Titan, which spanned over a decade, aimed to position Apple as a competitor in the electric vehicle market, challenging established companies like Tesla and Rivian. Despite never being officially confirmed by Apple, the project garnered significant attention as rumours swirled about the company's plans to introduce a fully automated, driverless car.

However, earlier this year, reports suggested that Apple had scaled back its project, opting for an electric vehicle with fewer self-driving features.

In response to the news, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter with a simple saluting emoji, highlighting the competitive dynamics within the tech industry.

Even though Apple had to stop working on Project Titan, which aimed to go beyond just making iPhones, they're still determined to use the latest technologies. The company has now changed its focus from electric cars to AI, with the release of the new headset, Vision Pro.

What do you make of this?"

The Vision Pro’s launch and its sell-out in a mere 18 minutes are a testament to the market’s eagerness to step into new dimensions of digital experiences. With competitors such as Google, Meta, Sony, and Microsoft in the VR headset market, Apple aims to redefine the landscape by pushing the boundaries of the use cases for the device, which may become a catalyst for an industry-wide revolution.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Vision Pro transcends being a mere product; it stands as a pivotal platform, intrinsic to Apple’s prospective expansion in extended reality, elevating its existing product ecosystem. Apple’s emphasis on designing products for widespread adoption set it apart from the competition’s priority of being fast and first. The market entry of such a company, boasting a unified product portfolio, an expansive user base, and unrivalled brand trust, carries substantial weight. The repercussions will include technologists intensifying their efforts, markets responding dynamically, investors regaining confidence, and strategic acquisitions coming to fruition. It serves as a resounding signal of confidence, igniting a renewed surge of innovation in the extended reality industry.

haluccy,2024-03-01,12380,https://www.instagram.com/p/C39zspqJOeX/,"The new Vision Pro mixed reality headset released by Apple this week has disappointed some of its buyers after discovering that the device does not support access to virtual reality (VR) pornographic content. Despite its high price tag, Vision Pro uses advanced technology to prevent users from accessing explicit content.

Many users were frustrated and called the Vision Pro a “$3,500 (around IDR 55 million) chastity belt” after discovering that the device couldn’t play pornographic videos in more immersive formats, such as the 180-degree side-by-side videos commonly found on websites explicit. Threads on Reddit have emerged, with users attempting to get around the Vision Pro’s restrictions on adult content. Despite attempts to use WebXR-related features to try to play such content, many users reported that the trick did not work, even when used on porn sites that supposedly support other VR devices such as Meta’s Oculus and Quest, as well as Microsoft’s Windows Mixed headset Reality. This comes as a disappointment to those who hoped the Vision Pro would bring a revolution in the virtual porn experience.

dailytrojan,2024-03-01,574,https://www.instagram.com/p/C39P9hUNUHN/,"Rylan Pozniak Daniels, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, has been involved in the developing world of virtual and augmented reality for almost a decade. To build on this passion, he worked closely with Apple’s new spatial operating system to develop ARLingo — the first spatial language-learning app to be available on the new Apple Vision Pro App Store.

During the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2023, Apple announced the creation of its first-ever virtual and augmented reality headset. Pre-orders began Jan. 19 leading into the official launch that was Feb. 2 — ARLingo was among the first apps to launch simultaneously.

Principled on the premise of creating an interactive environment through virtual characters, ARLingo is dedicated to “help users gain confidence in speaking new languages,” Daniels said. Through spatial computing, users are not only immersed in the region of their desired language, they also get to simultaneously interact with characters via their eyes, voice and hands.

In a written statement to the Daily Trojan, David Nelson, director of mixed reality research and development at the Institute for Creative Technologies — a unit of USC Viterbi — explained how spatial computing is able to provide such immersive and interactive experiences: “The Apple Vision Pro head-mounted-display (HMD) is outfitted with LiDAR and Depth sensors that create a fused 3D map of the environment, so that it can render digital content correctly in the space around the user.”

Daniels hopes that moving forward, technological advancements, like his app and those yet to come, will create positive and enriching impacts on language learners around the world.

“I really see this project and this app as an opportunity to facilitate global connection in today’s world,” Daniels said. “The long term vision is, if this app can enable more immersive language learning, it can also enable people around the world to connect in ways that weren’t possible before.”

mashable,2024-03-01,1023,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3-zixlNobi/,"Apple's Vision Pro launched this month, to the delight of Apple devotees everywhere. While issues with the Vision Pro have already begun circulating, it's not stopping owners from wearing the $3,500 piece any chance they get. Case in point: A man wore his Vision Pro at his wedding.

Software engineer Jacob Wright donned his headset during his February 10 wedding in Utah. Don't worry — he didn't wear it for the ceremony — but according to SFGate, he slipped it on for post-ceremony photos and dancing during the reception.

In a photo posted to X, formerly Twitter, Wright wears the headset, pinching something only he can see. His bride, Cambree Wright, looks incredulous. While she looks ""pissed"" in the photo that Wright posted, though, she said she wasn't. ""I wasn't really mad,"" she said in an interview with Futurism. ""I just thought it was funny."""

1. Tried Vision Pro for the very first time! Was fortunate to be invited to the inaugural event of Apple’s new HQ in Bangalore. It blows my mind to imagine that the Vision Pro is just a first generation product and it’s probably at the worst of its form. It’s only going to get better from here on 🤯 video coming soon!

2. The super kind @mufasayc who let me and everyone else try his brand-new Vision Pro 🤗

3. @ux.alok managed to click this meme material photo at the Apple HQ 🤓

4. Attended a proper destination wedding for the very first time in my life. This was one of the weddings where there was  a dress code for every individual event. This was the day of Haldi 🤑

4. I went through the whole wardrobe spectrum – from purely traditional to semi-formal, and then all the way up to full formal. This was the day for a Western wedding, and the groom was British 🇬🇧🤵‍♂️👰‍♀️

5. Caught up with friends over dinner and deserts. Had ordered many times from @kunafaworld before, but this was the first time where we visited one of their outlets.

While the couple will have a unique first-person view of their special day, the bride wasn’t entirely enthusiastic about her husband wearing the Vision Pro.

Expressing her discomfort, she mentioned, “I try not to look because it’s a little creepy, it’s a little uncanny. He probably asked me two or three times. I was like, ‘No, no, no, we have to wait, we have to wait! And then I turn around one minute, and he has it on.” The use of the headset added a distinct and somewhat unconventional touch to their wedding memories."

The move was greenlit by the Federal Government, a significant target for Mr Keating’s criticisms as of late – and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has had enough.

Mr Albanese explained the ruse to our reporter during his biweekly content strategy call he has with The Advocate’s editorial team.

“You know, uh, we all love Paul, uh, but, uh, yeah, there’s certainly a level of Paul that is too much,” said Albo.

“And it’s getting beyond the pale, uh, in that we were able to tolerate his criticisms of the submarine deal and, uh, you know, putting the dog up China over the spicy cough, but, uh, and this latest salvo against Penny Wong today, I mean, he’s a man possessed,”

“So I’ve had him placed into a virtual reality where it’s 1998 and John Howard is getting under his skin. I think it’s for the best. We’ve programmed Little Johnny to keep saying that he’s having to undo all the damage that the Keating Government did to the economy. Nothing gets him worked up more. Actually, we had an AI version Barnaby Joyce running over grandfather clocks in a D6. That damn near killed Paul so we scaled that back to Johnny,”

“We all love Paul but this is for the best. He needs to shut up and fuck off. It’s time.”

More to come."

2024 note: Created for a one-time viewing on a public access billboard in Times Square, NY. The intention of the film was to distract and disorient those passing by. The image is a result of thresholding a (real) shot of palm trees. In the few frames where the tree's shilloutette is visible, a viewer may subconsciously call into question image processing and its role in our perception of the natural world through digital means. As Apple's Vision Pro enters the marketplace and generative AI models such as Sora are being tested, it is important to consider how the human brain perceives and retains a given stimulant. What images are we creating and how will they affect us when beamed back?

businessinsiderssa,2024-03-06,87,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4LF4SZC3hF/,"The Apple CEO already has plenty on his plate as he attempts to make a success of a fresh hardware push from Cupertino following the launch of the Vision Pro last month.

The $3,500 headset represents Apple's big bet on mixed reality. But its hefty price tag — along with uncertainty around the mainstream appeal of the wearable gear — means Cook will have plenty of work to do to turn it into a consumer hit.

Unfortunately for Apple, that task could be complicated as signs emerge that its workhorse gadget needs a revamp.

Since 2007, when Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone onstage at a Macworld Expo, the device has become Apple's biggest moneymaker.

In its most recent quarter, Apple generated almost $70 billion of its $119.6 billion total revenue from iPhone sales. That was up from $65.8 billion a year earlier, showing growth is still happening in its most important product segment.

But that growth isn't exactly even.

China, Apple's most important international market, has started to sour on iPhones, bucking a trend of growth in other regions.

Apple shared signs of this trend starting to form in the last three months of 2023 as net sales in the Greater China region fell almost 13% from $23.9 billion in 2022 to $20.8 billion. That hasn't changed in 2024.

iPhone sales in China dropped 24% in the first six weeks of the year, according to data from Counterpoint Research. That has led Apple to slip to fourth spot in smartphone market share, behind local rivals Vivo, Huawei, and Honor.

There are some key reasons for this. For one, Beijing has made it less appealing to buy iPhones. It was reported by the Wall Street Journal in September that the Chinese government had banned officials from using iPhones.

Will Wong, a Singapore-based senior research manager with IDC's Asia/Pacific Client Devices Group, said a soft Chinese economy has led to more cautious consumer spending at large. He also pointed to a shift in consumer preferences in China as part of the reason Apple has lost its top spot."

iPhones? Killing it in sales. 
iPads? Not so much because we didn't see anything new on that front last year.

Here's the deal: Stagnation is the enemy. If you don't launch new offers or products those sales and growth numbers start to drop.

It's all about innovation, and with Apple getting ready to unleash cool tech like the Vision Pro headset onto the market, it's crystal clear—keeping the hype alive with constant launches is the secret sauce to keeping your audience hooked and the cash flowing. 

Whether it's spicing up what you already offer or throwing something totally new into the mix, staying on top of the game is what it's all about in this rapid-fire market.

So, let's take a leaf out of Apple's book and keep that launch train rolling.

Need help launching a new offer or product, locally or internationally? 
We're here to help you with every aspect of the launch and offer.

picklefigphoto,2024-03-06,282,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4LbR4eL9-V/,"DETERIORATE.

In this set of photos I wanted to further explore the idea of using cyberspace as a form of escape in a cyberpunk world. A world that we might be approaching since the release of Apple’s Vision Pro or Meta’s Quest model. I was inspired by the book The Electric State, Serial Experiments Lain, as well as my own depression. This time around, I wanted to take this series further into other aspects of an unhealthy mental state in a cyberpunk world. Since I was laid off from my job in June of 2023, I’ve noticed that it has become increasingly hard to be hopeful, a positive self esteem, and will to keep going. I noticed I was eating less, and poorly, but feeling like this was my only option. I wanted the subject to appear as if using cyberspace as an escape has had some negative effects on their health over time, as well as their self esteem and any will at all. The tears and stains in their shirt really represents the feeling of wallowing in a dark mental state. Major thank you to @chelseagarrett9 for modeling in this set! Thank you to @selarom_xela for letting us use your home and cool couch for the set!

今天特別前往交通委員會，質詢數位部唐鳳部長有關「電子簽章法」的議題。

上星期四行政院院會通過電子簽章法，對此我也恭喜並肯定唐鳳部長順利推出了他擔任部長後的第一部法案。

但法案中「緩衝期要三年」是我所不能接受！唐鳳部長作為數位人，應該很清楚數位世界每分每秒都在變動、進行技術革新，台灣要怎麼再等下一個三年？

更甚至，現在還是有「26個機關」排除電子簽章法的適用，行政院就是其中之一！司法院還直接在行政院版第一條第二項明定「司法程序不適用本法規定」，這不是直接打臉數位部嗎？這樣的結果，數位部敢說自己有積極協助、輔導各部會適應電子簽章嗎？如果連政府機關自己都不用電子簽章，你們推出的法案又有何說服力🔥？

從2001年NOKIA 3310、黑莓機時代，到去年發行iPhone 15、上個月開賣Vision Pro，我國電子簽章法經過「22年」的科技變革，卻都未曾修改。上週我召開記者會邀請了業界代表，大家均指出現行電子簽章的市場技術已經成熟，未來若普及運用，相信不但可以更加便民、也可以帶動相關產業蓬勃發展🦾

質詢的最後，我也邀請唐鳳部長來上我的podcast節目，大家敬請期待🤓🙌🏻"

popscigoods,2024-03-08,14,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Qrd1POkHY/,"@apple’s Vision Pro headset is far and away the most technically impressive and innovative piece of hardware the company has released in years. Borrowing design elements and components from its Mac laptops, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro, it’s hard not to be taken with how simple it is to use, and how well it works.⁠
⁠
We experienced no motion sickness even when using the headset while walking around and turning our head, a technical feat that solves the problem headset makers have struggled with for years. Similarly, navigating its user interface with nothing more than your eyes and tapping fingers felt familiar immediately.⁠
⁠
Native applications run smoothly—though there are only 1,000 currently available (developers can allow their iPad apps to run on the headset)—and we appreciate that information like contacts, notes, and Safari preferences were immediately synced over via iCloud.⁠
⁠
Viewing videos and photos, especially those captured in Apple’s “Spatial Video” format did feel more immersive than watching them on a screen, though the cameras on future iPhone and Vision Pro models will need to be improved to help it live up to its promise of helping you relive a memory.⁠

At $3,500 this headset’s price is prohibitive, but early adopters will be rewarded with a glimpse of what Apple considers the future of computing.⁠
⁠
✅ Pros ✅⁠
— Impressive fidelity⁠
— Immediately familiar user interface⁠
— Data syncing with other devices is top-notch⁠
⁠
❌ Cons ❌⁠
— Price⁠
— Weight⁠
— Limited assortment of native apps⁠
⁠
🧐 Verdict 🧐⁠
Apple’s long-rumored first-generation headset is technically dazzling but ultimately feels like a beta device that will require substantive software updates and a hardware revision to live up to its promises.⁠

We experienced the Apple Vision Pro marking a new chapter of immersive experiences. 👀

The room was alive with typewriting artists crafting instant poetry, mesmerizing magic acts by 🎩 @abracademy and live scribing by our @javier__navarro__arbe capturing the essence of our dialogues. 

I'm beyond grateful for each an every one of you who came: client, partner, speaker and those who couldn't make it - you were missed.

 Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to everyone who made this evening a reality. Your support, your openness and your passion are what the event so memorable.

Should we do this again? 🥹❤️

Project Titan, Apple’s secretive car program, has been cancelled after spending billions over the past decade.

As I discuss in a recent @bloombergoriginals interview, there are a few reasons why I think an Apple car would not have been the next big opportunity that some people were betting on:

➡️ Apple would not have been able to enjoy the kind of margins they enjoy on other hardware, as profits on EVs are coming down.
➡️ Apple has a bigger opportunity with Vision Pro to engage with consumers and business users alike, with the opportunity to drive revenue from content as well as hardware.
➡️ There are a lot of learnings from the car that we’ve already seen in other products, like the crash detection feature on the iPhone. This makes it clear to me that the time spent on Project Titan is far from wasted. 
➡️ Apple still has a big opportunity to use CarPlay to deliver an In-Car Experience that delights users, leaving the actual car manufacturer to deal with any negative sentiment around car issues—or even worse, a malfunction.

If Apple’s Vision PRO becomes the next “iPhone”, we will see a new generation of people with eyesight and sleeping problems.

While this technology can be considered “the future”, Big Tech is failing to tell you the truth about VR and artificial light in general.

Your eye's constant exposure to artificial light will accelerate ocular deterioration and disrupt the intricate balance of your circadian rhythms.

Children's eyes are particularly sensitive to the effects of artificial light.

The lens of a child's eye is clearer than that of an adult, allowing more blue light to penetrate deep into the eye and potentially cause damage to the retina.

The effects of early and prolonged exposure to harmful light emissions can set the stage for ocular conditions later in life, such as early-onset macular degeneration or digital eye strain.

It can also contribute to the development of myopia (nearsightedness) due to the close-up nature of screen interactions.

Luckily, there are steps you can take today to protect your kids from Big Tech greed.

It’s important to take off the headset, turn off your phone, and not abandon the real world so quickly.

Children should be getting outside, riding their bicycles, climbing trees, and socializing. They deserve the same real-world privileges we had growing up.

I will get you more information like this so you can start integrating changes into your kid’s life.

Just comment the word “GIFT” right now and join to my VIP newsletter, no strings attached.

I’ll send you some of my top resources based around the things we commonly see with patients

Like Hippocrates said: “The greatest medicine of all is teaching people how not to need it.”

I’m committed to helping you get the results you’re looking for and I’m looking forward to speaking with you soon.

The device allowed them to see the real world but with superimposed virtual screens in front of them showing vital information through augmented reality. 

🤖 The underlying AI software of the Vision Pro keeps a note of each stage of the operation and in the future will measure how well it went against similar procedures performed by other surgeons.

👉 This approach is seen as a significant advancement in surgical practices, potentially reducing errors and increasing efficiency. The initiative is part of a broader movement towards integrating advanced technologies like AI into healthcare, with discussions underway for further adoption within the NHS.

The study comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to dump on the Apple Vision Pro, his top competitor in the space. Last week, Zuckerberg said Apple's VR headset was ""worse in most ways.""

The study said only a third of users even noticed the glitch when their session was hijacked, and all but one user chalked it up to a normal performance issue.

In a groundbreaking event at Cromwell Hospital, UK, surgeons utilized Vision Pro, with a scrub nurse wearing the device during a spinal surgery. Suvi Verho, lead scrub nurse, lauded its error-reducing capabilities. Surgeon Syed Aftab praised its transformative impact on team members' proficiency. 

Earlier, Dr. Robert Masson employed Vision Pro in a spinal procedure, emphasizing its enhancement of workflow. Apple emphasizes its growing use in healthcare, with Stryker and Siemens Healthineers leveraging its capabilities.

This is the first time Apple Vision Pro has been used in surgery. The device is used to prepare, monitor procedures, and select the right tools in spinal surgery.

This device allows them to see the real world with a virtual screen in front of it that displays important information known as augmented reality, launched the Daily Mail, Tuesday (12/3/2024).

Suvi Verho, head nurse at London's Independent Hospital, said the technology was a game changer and added that the Apple Vision Pro could eliminate the potential for human error.

The underlying AI software also records each stage of the operation and in the future will measure how well it performs compared to similar procedures performed by other surgeons.
""It gives you confidence in the surgery,"" says Suvi.

“My relationship with painting is very physical. In my process I manipulate the surface of each piece, granting the work a sculptural quality. I move around the painting, positioning myself to direct paint flow from specific angles. The process lends itself to the build-up of layers, capturing traces of time and movement. The practice is both seductive and uncertain. Fluid media is sensitive to its environment; a deep breath, a slight shift of focus, a sound in the distance all impact the process, causing the marks to sway from their predetermined path.”

We delved into the future of VC investment, pinpointing trends and opportunities critical for tomorrow’s success.

The concept of creating ‘centers of gravity’ to foster vibrant economies resonated deeply, alongside UrbanLogiq’s groundbreaking announcement of their new AI tool designed for government efficiency.

The engagement with next-gen audiences and the profound exploration of AI’s role in creativity, storytelling, and identity further highlighted the multifaceted nature of our discussions.

Each session, whether focused on investment, innovation, sustainability, or the digital future, underscored a unified message: the power of technology to drive positive change is immense, yet it requires thoughtful application and collaborative effort to fully realize its potential.

theinfomance,2024-03-17,3124,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4nLopKyE4E/,"Apple's Vision Pro,a  mixed reality headset, has been praised for its ability to bridge the gap between real and virtual worlds. The device offers features such as surround-sound streaming videos, life-sized video calls, and immersive gaming. Recently, it was used by surgeons in the UK during a complex spinal surgery at Cromwell Hospital in London. The team integrated AI and AR into operating rooms using the Vision Pro during live surgery. A scrub nurse wore the headset throughout the operation, accessing real-time data streaming, facilitating surgical preparation, tracking progress, and selecting appropriate instruments while maintaining a clear view of the real world overlaid with vital information on virtual screens. The headset also assisted in preparation, surgery tracking, and tool selection for the surgeon. The use of the Vision Pro in surgeries is not new, with Stryker and Cinematic Reality by Siemens Healthineers using it for joint replacement surgery planning and interactive holograms of the human body.

Pedro believes tha every series of works needs an artist statement of its own.
The following is the latest artist statement, something I wrote for my current body of work:
“It is still night; at this time of the year, dawn comes late. The path is along the beach; someday they will build a road here, they said.
 Upon reaching the canoe, the day has already begun; it’s a race against time. If the 9 o’clock sun catches you, you’re lost, they said.
Binoculars and a hat. A smell of stagnant water, sunscreen, and insect repellent. The swamp doesn’t reach your knees, they said. 
The sun still doesn’t warm up; among the mangroves, everything is dark. Trash, birds, and fishermen; the atmosphere is humid and dense,  even though they clean it up daily here, they said. 
The mangrove opens up; it’s hard to distinguish where the sky ends and the water begins.
This is what I’m painting: a silent, nostalgic Caribbean.
A time of day when the sun still doesn’t overwhelm. A small temporal space that is important, simultaneously ephemeral and eternal.”

The future of medicine is here, and it's wearing a headset! Surgeons at London's Cromwell Hospital just used the new Apple Vision Pro during spine surgery, and it's a total game-changer.

Forget browsing cat videos – Apple's mixed-reality headset is now stepping up to assist in complex medical procedures. While surgeons didn't wear the headset themselves, a scrub nurse used it to view virtual screens and access surgical info.

Syed Aftab, a surgeon on the team, says the Apple Vision Pro ""made a huge difference"" in patient care. He loved how seamless the software was and how it boosted efficiency.

This isn't just a one-time thing. Cromwell Hospital is all about innovation, and they're excited to see how this tech takes off in hospitals everywhere.

Social media is buzzing about the possibilities. People are saying this could be a major leap forward for medicine, with potential to reduce errors and improve outcomes.

Apple's also pumped about the healthcare applications for Vision Pro. New health apps are popping up all the time, offering everything from mental health support to surgical training.

Apple Vision Pro is an augmented reality headset that adds virtual elements to your real environment using cameras and sensors, rather than being see-through. It also mirrors your eyes onto the outside by capturing them from the inside.

VisionOS, the new operating system, emphasizes productivity and entertainment. It supports windowed apps and offers immersive 3D experiences for watching videos and playing games. Integration with Mac allows for a virtual screen to act as an external monitor.

Input is intuitive, requiring no special devices. Users can interact using their eyes and hands, as well as through voice commands or virtual/hardware keyboards.

Content offerings include Apple TV+ and Disney+ from the outset. The mindfulness app provides a glimpse into creating fully immersive experiences. Users can also capture 3D photos and videos for their own content creation.

An optional external battery (or fixed power source) is available, which may seem unusual to some.

Petrelli depicts the infinite impotence of the human being in front of the occult, the “non-manifest”. The artist acquires the gift of a prophetic power, an intuition coming from the fall of all mental schemes. A means of revealing to the common man something happening in one of the three times (present, past or future).

 Sometimes the subjects look pure and free, sometimes ugly and gloomy. The dynamism of the lines highlights this unstoppable succession of states in continuous evolution.

In recent times, we've witnessed people exploring VR in various ways. Some casually take a stroll while wearing a VR headset, while others use it exclusively for gaming. Just recently, there was a sighting of a man in Bengaluru enjoying a meal at a restaurant with a VR headset on. 

The video showed a man sitting alone at a small table, sipping coffee. He was seen making hand gestures to navigate through the virtual world displayed in his VR device, sparking memes and conversations online. Some found it amusing, while others raised concerns about the downsides of technology. One commenter humorously remarked, ""This virus is spreading quickly."" Another person jokingly claimed, ""Bengaluru is now overrun by vision pro zombies."" However, there were also voices of caution, highlighting the potential risks of wearing VR headsets while walking on city streets, saying “Don’t try in Koramangala. Full of potholes.”

More of Laurents work can be found in Kaleidos Art Universe Collection.

From recreation (viewing movies) to experiencing special moments captured and rendered in Spatial Video to enhanced productivity (who needs multiple monitors?), this device is going to transform the way we consume and create.

A study from @Stanford University studied how hundreds of retirees experienced virtual reality, some of them for the first time. Participants were able to choose a VR experience from flying a jet plane, going to the International Space Station, or playing with puppies. 

The results were astounding, and illustrate why VR is being rapidly adopted by care homes around the world.

80% of participants reported a more positive attitude after their VR session and said they felt stronger bonds with their caregivers, and 60% said they felt less socially isolated.

Care homes around the world are rapidly buying up headsets like @Apple’s Vision Pro.

Caregivers say VR can spur memories that lead to more conversations and can even defend against brain diseases like dementia.

🌍 VR developer Mynd Immersive has integrated Google Earth into their platform, so residents can revisit locations from the past, like their old school or home.

north.eastern.chronicle,2024-03-21,2845,https://www.instagram.com/p/C4x9zmELQnN/,"Users of Apple devices in India are being warned about a significant security threat by the country’s security agency, CERT-In. The warning, issued on March 19, highlights vulnerabilities affecting various Apple products including Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, and Vision Pro. 

These vulnerabilities could potentially allow attackers to remotely access devices, exposing personal and confidential information, and causing severe disruptions to the targeted systems. The security bulletin identifies specific versions of software affected by the vulnerability, including Apple’s visionOS, macOS Monterey, macOS Ventura, macOS Sonoma, watchOS, Safari, and tvOS. CERT-In emphasizes that these vulnerabilities could enable attackers to access sensitive information, execute arbitrary code, and bypass security measures, potentially gaining elevated privileges on the compromised systems.

Notably, the issue impacts a wide range of Apple devices such as Vision Pro, Apple TV HD, 4K models, Apple Watch Series 4, and later models, as well as recent MacBook models. To mitigate the risk posed by these vulnerabilities, users are advised to promptly update their devices to the latest software versions provided by Apple. 

Updates can be installed by navigating to General – Settings – Software Update on the device and installing any available updates to ensure the security of their Apple devices.

My favourite feature is the eye strain. 

Interesting tech, I can’t see any immediate uses for it but it’s definitely a fun thing to have a go with.

I could definitely feel the eye strain after wearing it for 10-15mins during the demo though, I felt like I’d been focusing on something held way too close to my face: something I’ve never really had with VR headsets like Vive and Oculus.
Also, with a device that heavy it’s funny that it was demoed with only a back-of-head strap, not one over the top!
[edited because apparently it does come with a top of head strap]

Not an ad or anything. You can book a 30m demo at Apple stores in the USA.

During a recent operation to repair a patient's spine at the private Cromwell Hospital in London, a nurse used the Vision Pro to help prepare for surgery, keep track of the procedure, and choose proper tools. This is the first operation (in the UK) where the Vision Pro was used.

The software on Apple's headset is from U.S. company eXeX. It offers nurses and technicians touch-free access to a surgical setup and procedural guides from within the sterile field of the operating room. The software also tracks each stage of an operation and can measure how well it went compared to previous procedures.

My intention is to get the images to strike and shake the observer, through the figures presented in the middle of the painting, in an almost symmetric way, observing their most personal moment. Therefore, in front of the work we play the role of voyeurs but without a dirty, lewd, or lascivious gaze.”

Inspired by the wisdom of African proverbs and the richness of the continent, he creates vibrant images that veer between visual poetry and color therapy. He employs his unique chromatic language, stark silhouettes, which translate as lessons learned from proverbial storytelling to challenge negative and limited perceptions of African culture. Since the beginning of his artistic journey, photography and post-production have been entirely iPhone-based.His work brims with energy, color and meaning, which are also the leading principles of Hueism.

The Apple Vision Pro, as a hardware product, may not directly pose questions about digital real estate ownership for ads. However, the impact of technologies like augmented reality (AR) on advertising and digital experiences could prompt discussions about the future ownership and control of virtual spaces for advertisements and branding. As AR becomes more integrated into daily life, questions about ownership, access, and regulation of digital real estate in AR environments will arise.

I use mediums of oil and gouache painting to interpret figurative imagery in expressive yet somewhat ascetic way. When depicting the human, I reduce the environmental details to a minimum and concentrate on abstract shapes and colors in order to convey the inner state of the person.”

🎧 Current headsets like Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro use optical tracking for finger tracking, but this approach has limitations like accuracy issues, high latency, occlusion problems, and performance issues in dim lighting.

💥 Meta uses an alternative method called electromyography (EMG), which senses muscle activation through a wristband. 

🚀 EMG could offer zero or negative latency, perfect accuracy, work in any lighting, and avoid occlusion.

krisfade,2024-03-24,4089,https://www.instagram.com/p/C45sqO7peui/,"My honest review on the Apple Vision Pro! 

The technology is ridiculously cool! As soon as you put them on, you’re blown away with how futuristic it all seems. 

You use your eyes to control “the mouse/cursor” and your hands to select what you want and move the individual screens around. 

Watching movies is next level and some of the Apple immersive experiences are really fantastic. 

To think you can be walking down the street whilst watching an NBA Game, checking Instagram and a FaceTime call all happening at the same time is fantastic (but also scary) 

Some of the negatives are, the device doesn’t connect or communicate with your phone, which I found weird and slightly annoying. 

There are not many apps available for the Vision Pro, so it’s limited. Even connecting to WhatsApp has been a struggle. The device itself is heavier than I expected and after wearing it for more than 30minutes can begin to be annoying. 

Trying to use it in the dark (when Brianna is sleeping for example) is near impossible, the tracking doesn’t really work. 

I paid 4200usd (about 15k aed) was it worth it? Definitely not! Is it ridiculously cool, absolutely. 

I can’t wait for the technology over the next 5 years. It’s going to be scary on just how real the non real will be.

⁠
I will never forget the moment my grandparents turned on their first color TV. They were awestruck by the magic in the box. Born before radio, telephone and passenger airplanes, in the early 1960s my family chipped in to buy them an expensive new color TV console, which filled their small living room. (My parents would not get a color set themselves for another five years.) I loved watching cartoons on this phenomenal appliance, as animated drawings came to life in living color.⁠
⁠
The art and craft of animation has precipitously evolved in so many high-tech ways since then—from Disney and Looney Tunes to Pixar, from hand-drawn art to computer renderings, from movies to JigSpace for Apple Vision Pro—however, I am still in awe of screen-based “motion.” And like many of you who have Steampunk or nostalgia leanings for the past, I’ve become less interested in complex computer-generated gyrations and prefer simple and limited motion, like the kind that Klaas Verplancke and Arevik d’Or have collaborated on producing.⁠
⁠
For nearly a decade, Verplancke and d’Or have collaborated on assignments for The New Yorker, The New York Times, MOMA New York, Poster House, Centre Pompidou Paris, Marc O’Polo, and others. And now, they have formally teamed up as partners in creating Studio Pomid’Or, an “organic graphic animation studio” that expands a long-standing creative relationship between the two artists. Together they “create a rich vision for the development of artistic visual products with particular attention to every detail,” says Verplancke.⁠

“I believe the human body is the best art out there; nothing is more beautiful, complex, or inspiring than the physical and emotional components that make us.
Art helped me find myself at a point where I was asking, “what do I do with my life?”
Here I am several years later, a self-taught artist drawn to creating pieces that talk about our life as human beings, and our relationship with each other. I confess that I prefer portraying the female form because I find it so much more interesting.One of my biggest goals is to make every piece I create tell an emotional story. Because of this, my media has evolved over the years from charcoal on paper to charcoal and acrylic on canvas.”

The match directors Bryan Lewis and Andy Slade never disappoint putting so much passion in to there matches going as far as adjusting some targets sizes for day two.

He is a French Contemporary artist whose pectoral works show spontaneity, vehemence while keeping in mind humour and self-derision.
A proud product of Punk Rock culture, Yann Sciberras creates art that is eclectic and energetic, wacky and offbeat, and oh so very urban. His work serves as a sort of social protest, a punch in the face of contemporary consumer culture. His art screams : signs, images, words, and warnings are rendered in vivid colors. And yet, Sciberras’ paintings do not moralize ; they simply bear witness to our shared society. With words flashing as slogans, his artwork opens out towards the world as a stunning comunication tool – a form of visual poetry.

“The death of a moment is the best proof of its existence.”

Cesar Biojo´s works are oil portraits created from pictorial resources that are destroyed immediately leaving an evidence behind. This way the concept of time is introduced, connecting concepts inherent in the human being such as creation and destruction, the perishable and ephemeral. His work becomes an introspective study of human beings, their conflicts, their nature and existence.

Pedro believes tha every series of works needs an artist statement of its own.
The following is the latest artist statement, something I wrote for my current body of work:
“It is still night; at this time of the year, dawn comes late. The path is along the beach; someday they will build a road here, they said.
 Upon reaching the canoe, the day has already begun; it’s a race against time. If the 9 o’clock sun catches you, you’re lost, they said.
Binoculars and a hat. A smell of stagnant water, sunscreen, and insect repellent. The swamp doesn’t reach your knees, they said. 
The sun still doesn’t warm up; among the mangroves, everything is dark. Trash, birds, and fishermen; the atmosphere is humid and dense,  even though they clean it up daily here, they said. 
The mangrove opens up; it’s hard to distinguish where the sky ends and the water begins.
This is what I’m painting: a silent, nostalgic Caribbean.
A time of day when the sun still doesn’t overwhelm. A small temporal space that is important, simultaneously ephemeral and eternal.”

István is not only creating a next level, forward thinking CAD system for designers, he is building a team and company of superstars from across the globe. The Shapr3D group was a blast and I made instant connections and friendships. That’s the kind of good people who’s making software tailored for us Industrial Designers! 👊🏼

I can’t wait to start using the @shapr3dapp in my design workflow. Speaking with one of the head developers while we toured Budapest, I pointed out after demoing Shapr that one “tap” on screen with an Apple Pencil takes about 10 “clicks” of a mouse with other CAD systems that I’ve used. That time adds up when you are drawing all day/week. Shapr3d is going to save me a lot of time especially in conceptualization! 

Finally, one of the absolute highlights of my trip was meeting and spending the day with @cancridesign and @sam_does_design. I’ve followed both for years with great admiration. (You probably already follow both, but if not, make sure you do now, don’t miss out on excellent design content and longer). We had really great conversations, swapped design stories and insights. I’ve left Budapest so inspired!"
thevergeart,2024-03-27,175,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5BxdopxuMr/,"On my wedding day, I took off all my wearables. 

I had many reasons why. I didn’t want any distractions. It seemed ridiculous to squeeze in a workout on my big day just to keep my streaks going. As a wearables reviewer, I didn’t want to bring work to my wedding. Plus, there wasn’t a strap in the world that would’ve camouflaged the Apple Watch or whatever other tracker I was testing. I didn’t want my Oura Ring memorialized in my wedding photos, either. So I left everything on their chargers.

I didn’t think too hard about it until the other week when I saw a Threads post. “Normalize not wearing your Apple Watch to fancy dinners,” it read. I thought about it again when I saw a picture of a guy wearing an Apple Vision Pro at his wedding, the bride looking on in what I assume to be disbelief. The ensuing discourse online reminded me that uncertainty was another reason why I left the wearables off on my wedding day. Wearable tech, while more commonplace than the days of Google Glass, is still an emerging category — and one where the social script is still being written.

~
I’ve also just had two cups of coffee, another drug.
~
I’m about to drive to our Physiology First University campus, crank music, and lift heavy weights. Another drug?
~
Behavior is driven by dopamine via a cue and craving mechanism. Dopamine is then released in our brain’s reward pathway. This is followed by a “dopamine deficit” state to cause craving for future action.
~
What makes a substance, product, or behavior addictive?
~
Access: Is it easy to get? Caffeine stops working after a few cups, as it has sufficiently blocked adenosine in the brain. There is a necessary refractory period. Heavy weights don’t get any lighter as fatigue sets in. The iPhone never fatigued as long as we have our charger nearby…
~
Quantity: There’s always another swipe…
~
Potency: Depends on what we’re watching. How does Apple Vision Pro and A.R impact the potency factor this year?

Novelty: I can predict what’s going to happen during my strength training session this morning. I don’t know what’s on the next IG Reel if I choose to swipe….
~
What goes up must come down. The dopamine surge from social media is followed by a dopamine deficit. When we confuse this for a psychological disorder we risk diagnosing a generation of kids as mentally ill for their healthy response to unhealthy technologies.
~
“Dopamine is the final common pathway of all addictive substances and behaviors. It’s the currency neuroscientist’s use to measure the addictive potential nature of something. ~ Anne Lembke, Dopamine Nation
~
We can argue about the semantics of whether the objects of motivation that drive us forward in our life, while requiring careful balance to manage, should be classified as “drugs.” 
~
But the bottles of addictive pills prescribed to 12 year olds by practitioners who can not differentiate between physiology, and psychology, are definitely drugs.”- @physiologyfirst"

Aside from AI, the developer-centric event is expected to feature significant announcements related to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and the Vision Pro. There are also strong rumors about new Apple Silicon and potential new AI-optimized Mac releases.

The spotlight will likely be on Apple’s AI plans, as the company has to catch up to the marketplace. CEO Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” to be unveiled “later this year,” and WWDC is the logical place to make these announcements. iOS 18 is rumored to be the “most significant update” ever, with a focus on AI tools designed to help manage daily life. We’ll see.

According to the announcement, WWDC 2024 will include a special in-person event at Apple Park on opening day for developers and students, although the scale remains smaller compared to pre-pandemic events. The conference follows closely after Google I/O and Microsoft Build, and its announcement comes amidst a recent DOJ lawsuit against Apple over alleged monopolistic practices surrounding the iPhone. Exciting times for the tech giants!

Children often see us when we are not looking. Abandoned by family, their photos haunt me. Ridiculous clothing and hair inspire me. Remarkably, they don’t care what they become when they grow up. Impostors of ideas, surrogates of thought. Embellished personas rather than people. Peppered with improvisation, they are amusing to death. Reincarnated children entertain me.

My body of work, Offspring, explores my innate desire to create paintings as a form of legacy and immortality. Children derived from old photos and found objects are my subjects and they awaken my inner child, an endless source of creativity.

Within seconds the Vision Pro had photographed more of his apartment and body than his laptop saw over the decade he had it.

Cassandra Kim is a contemporary artist whose paintings explore the unique personalities and characteristics of animals and reflect a lifelong love traditional art. Inspired by the master painters of the past, she seeks to put her own slightly absurd surreal twist on art by replacing animals with people. Pairing an unexpected animal with the costumes from past societies creates a visual paradox that inadvertently humanizes the portraiture and often makes people smile.

An ex-Apple employee’s attempts at sabotage have backfired horribly, as the company is now suing him for allegedly leaking company secrets to journalists in an effort to pressure the iPhone maker to abandon certain projects. 

According to MacRumors, former iOS software engineer Andrew Aude used the leaks “so he could ‘kill’ products and features with which he took issue.” These leaks included sharing details about Apple’s then-secret Vision Pro headset with a non-company employee back in 2020. 

The lawsuit, which was filed in California’s Superior Court, states that Apple caught Aude leaking the info from his company-issued iPhone. The lawsuit even contains a screenshot of a text he allegedly sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter. “Can’t wait for chaos to break out before Apple corporate people even wake up,” Aude supposedly wrote at one point.

Apple further alleges that Aude spent five years leaking details of “about more than a half- dozen different Apple policies and products” during his stint at the company. For even more details, head to PCMag.

“My paintings are created in a space between abstract and figurative art. 
They are associative, intuitive and inspired by inner visions. The shapes, objects, landscapes and humans are situated in a fictive space and enter into a conversation with the viewer at a deep level. 

Painting for me is the most “fluid” way to come to terms with the things I experience and want to express. What I want to express is not an idea or concept. I want to invite into a space of associations, into a space like a poem  or music that can only be understood by letting it act.”

vr_me_candice,2024-03-31,106,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5LjzoprjV_/,"My experience trying out the Apple Vision Pro was a mixed bag of excitement and concern. The 30mins demo offered a glimpse into its capabilities, showcasing basic 360 photos and videos, as well as immersive 3D content (more enticing). The visuals were impressive -sharp, pulling me into a world of *spatial computing*. The interface design, with its intuitive gestures like pinching, swiping, and zooming, felt intuitive but not new. To be honest, I use the exact same gestures with the Quest3.

A major concern arose regarding the device’s user approach. The one-device-per-user setup felt restrictive and somewhat inconvenient. Setting up the device for my vision took a significant chunk of time, with the automatic lens distance adjustment and custom eye tracking adding complexity to the process. While these features ensure a custom experience, they also hinder the device’s ease of sharing among multiple users. This limitation could potentially dampen its practicality in certain scenarios, I’m thinking about academia and education where students have to share devices.

I remain optimistic about the Apple Vision Pro’s potential. I’m eager to explore more applications beyond the demo setting. As technology evolves and developers work on its capabilities, I anticipate a broader range of experiences that could truly showcase the device’s value.

nobhillgazette,2024-04-03,4,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5T9016S9N8/,"Although it hit the market last summer, the Apple Vision Pro (from $3,499) remains the leading wearable tech device for spatial computing, which, in a nutshell, means the blending of digital and physical realities. Using precision eye-tracking made up of LEDs and infrared cameras, the system allows you to select elements just by looking directly at them, while tapping your index finger and thumb together expands or reduces other elements — you can even type on keys using a virtual keyboard. And the high-resolution display and advanced spatial audio system offer users an incredible 3D auditory environment. Just slip on the cushioned headset to work on your virtual desktop, surf the web, answer emails, take Zoom calls, watch favorite shows, or unwind in one of the preinstalled environments (like White Sands, Yosemite or a rainstorm on Mount Hood). The best part is that the space around you remains visible, and if someone is there IRL, you can still make eye contact through the headset.

The film introduces the world to its new creative director, especially on #AppleVisionPro and introduces early adopters to a new form factor. The story takes viewers through the weeks leading up to de Sarno’s debut show in September 2023; called Gucci Ancora (meaning “again”), the collection arrives in stores this month. While multiple brands have experimented with shoppable stores using the Vision Pro, Gucci started with an approach that more heavily emphasises art and entertainment (and brand education), hoping that viewing immersive films is likely a more familiar experience than making purchases while immersed in a headset.

designed2invest,2024-04-04,7,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5UQGX8v91V/,"Following the cessation of its electric vehicle initiative, Apple is now delving into the realm of personal home robots, as reported by Bloomberg. Engineers at Apple are reportedly exploring the concept of a home robot that can accompany users throughout their residences, along with a tabletop device utilizing robotics to adjust a display screen. This shift comes after Apple shut down its Special Projects Group, the team dedicated to electric cars, signaling a redirection of resources from one moonshot project to another. The initial concept of Apple’s car project emerged in 2014, with the company recruiting automotive engineers and expanding into new product markets. Despite the setback in its electric vehicle venture, Apple continues to invest heavily in innovative products and services, such as the Apple Watch and the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, which is anticipated to generate significant revenue in the future.

Overseeing the development of personal robotics at Apple are its hardware engineering division and artificial intelligence and machine learning group. Although still in the early stages of research and development, the home robot project signifies Apple’s commitment to exploring new frontiers in technology. This move mirrors initiatives by other tech giants like Amazon, which introduced the Astro home robot in 2021, featuring a smart display on wheels powered by Alexa. While the Astro remains available in limited quantities, Amazon has also ventured into business applications, offering a version of Astro designed for security purposes. As Apple remains tight-lipped about its foray into personal robotics, the industry eagerly awaits further developments in this burgeoning field.

⁠
The tech company announced a new look for “spatial personas,” which allow users to see and interact with the ghostlike, disembodied virtual heads of up to four other Pro-using friends. ⁠
⁠
While the original personas were limited to just FaceTime and Zoom (and even more haunting to look at), the new update allows users to access the feature in SharePlay-enabled apps to play games, watch movies, and more.⁠
⁠
The mixed-reality device had been criticized for leaving some users feeling cut off from the rest of the world, but the new feature is meant to improve collaboration. ⁠

⁠
Among the projects reportedly in the works are a mobile robot that follows users around their homes and a robotic tabletop smart display, Bloomberg reported.⁠
⁠
Work on the robotics projects are taking place in Apple's engineering and AI divisions, with the robotic smart display being further along than the mobile robot, according to those familiar. ⁠
⁠
As demand for the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of the company's $383 billion in sales last year, slows in key markets like China, Apple is trying to identify new long-term sources of revenue. Its recently launched Vision Pro headset is not expected to become a cash cow for the company for several years. ⁠
⁠
Robotics are suddenly all the rage as AI picks up steam. At the end of February, names like OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Jeff Bezos invested $675 million in the 18-month-old robotics startup Figure AI. ⁠

maltadaily.mt,2024-04-06,101,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5a6fMVI2qx/,"After the release of the much awaited Apple Vision Pro and the discontinuation of its plans to develop a self driving car akin to a Tesla, Apple have reportedly shifted their focus on robotics, more specifically a home robot.

The company is looking to move in a new direction and explore new ideas after a rough couple of few years which saw them be hit by an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice. Apple has also experienced a sharp decline in iPhone sales in China and a $1.8 billion fine from the EU for breaking rules over music streaming.

This idea is still in a largely theoretical stage of development and it’s not clear whether any domestic devices produced by Apple will make it as far consumer markets. Reports suggest that SafetyOS, the operating system designed for prospective self-driving cars, could potentially be adapted for use in robotics applications.

One source reportedly told Bloomberg that one potential project involves a “mobile robot” designed to accompany users throughout their homes.Additionally, there are rumors circulating about an innovative tabletop device capable of utilizing robotics to manipulate a display.

“My intention is to transmit through metaphor and symbolism, sensations, ideas, reflections on different themes, each work is delimited in a different context. I look for the viewer to reflect on a specific theme and enrich the work with its different conclusions.
I tend to use automatism at the beginning of a work, for me it is impossible to work on a blank canvas, for this reason, I stain the canvas unconsciously to then extract some figurative forms and make them more defined, I do not usually make previous sketches. Then my work becomes more analytical and reflective in a conscious way, this is where symbols, metaphors and associations appear.”

I’ve never experienced anything quite like it. The technology is amazing! It will change the way we experience content at home and it will change the way we work. It can also immerse you in parts of the world you might have always wanted to see or have only imagined. It is hard to describe how good this is…you simply have to experience it…! @apple #Apple #AppleVisionPro Vision Pro"

This is not about isolation."" Immediately I knew that this product would disconnect people and isolate them. Whenever a politician or salesman overemphasizes something, you can be certain that the exact opposite is true. ⁠
⁠
I recently did a podcast with Cory Sandhagen, UFC fighter, and he told me that you can uncover a fighter's weaknesses by the words they choose. If they say something specific, like my wrestling is really good, this means that wrestling is actually their weakness. ⁠
⁠
People compensate for what they lack with their words. So anytime someone overcompensates with language be aware that this is may be a tactic of deception or diversion. ⁠

“My paintings are emotion conductors”
“The subjects of alienation and intimacy are very present in my work, as well as the concept of the disruptive effect of modern technologies in human relationships.
I am developing the ideas of a world with unclear limits, fading certain parts of the painting, introducing instability and fluidity for the figures inhabiting them. The idea of deep desire and inmost subconscious ideas are also coming to the surface, in disguise, or in the form of avatars. All of this is a way to convey something, but also having fun making the colours and even the painting matter play together. The main characters of these stories can either be people or objects, sometimes”.

Last night Philip sat on the couch playing FFXIV and I sat next to him playing FFXIV as well, but I was using my Vision Pro to see my screen while he used his TV. I was streaming my Series X to the Vision Pro via the OneCast app with almost no latency. We played together and cleared about 6 dungeons this way!

We normally play together most nights, but in separate rooms (consoles + tv). Philip said he enjoyed the couch co-op vibes a lot!

I also liked being able to position my screen wherever I wanted as I relaxed on the couch. I also had Reddit and Safari pulled up and floating nearby to reference guides/walkthroughs for each dungeon.

if you are looking for help in deploying your own, Snap, AR filters in the Vision Pro connect with Vincent here on his LinkedIn

Contact Vincent here. https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-trastour/

The AR experience you were seeing I made about a year ago it’s called Spike and it runs normally on Snapchat! I was trying to make a stop motion like character during October to crawl across your face and mixture of creepy and cute.

⚠️ disclaimers
 It will not allow you to use this in FaceTime calls at the moment of recording this
it will not allow you to deploy snap lenses that require the external facing cameras, as Apple does not allow developers access to this data yet.

“My work ranges from the large sculpture designed for public spaces to the more private studio work, both 2D and 3D, that I do on a day-to-day basis. 
I am fascinated by structures that are geometric and yet organic, much in the way that a sunflower is both of those things at the same time. I look for these kinds of forms and patterns in nature and try to translate these into sculptural forms and into lyrical motion patterns, something hard to show convincingly in still images. At times I have also used music as another elements that will run alongside the visual motion of the work”.

Yesterday Darce & I hit the shopping trail. A massive mall; American Eagle, Aeropostale, Apple Store for a Vision Pro demo, and then the KiwiMart (sorry Walmart). 

Later we went into town to complete the consumerism experience for another fabulous barbecue at Cooper's Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que. We love that place. 

After that, we wall out onto the Congress Avenue Bridge to watch the one and a half million bats come streaming out at sundown. The way you do. 

A 1980 renovation transformed the bridge into an ideal bat cave, soon attracting migrating Mexican free-tailed bats. Decades later, Austin's bat numbers have swelled and locals have adopted the beloved creatures as neighbours who happily handle the city's bug mitigation and provide an amazing nightly show.

To top of the night off we went to go and see stand-up comic Margaret Cho at the Paramount. Her stand-up is absolute filth. Some walked out. We loved it. 

Oh and we popped into Iron Bear gay bar on the way home to watch a Mario kart tournament. Rainbow Road indeed. 

Next stop Houston. (Now my passport was arrived!)

Dyson announced an augmented reality vacuuming feature called CleanTrace that shows where you have and haven’t vacuumed.

CleanTrace will be available for the Dyson Gen5detect system starting in June. The technology will be geared at phones, rather than, say, an Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest headset.

In the demos, the system creates a purple overlay, showing the path the vacuum has taken up to that point. The objective is to turn the entire room that color to ensure you’ve hit all the spots.

chartrdaily,2024-04-15,2336,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5yc-L1A-fA/,"📱Samsung has reclaimed its position as the world's largest smartphone seller, dethroning Apple in the first quarter of 2024. Preliminary data from research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) revealed that Samsung shipped a market-leading 60 million units, some 20% more than Apple during the same period.⁠
⁠
🥇 Although Samsung's return to the top spot is not entirely surprising — iPhone sales historically peak in the fourth quarter, and the two smartphone giants constantly tussle for #1 — what is noteworthy is the nearly 10% year-over-year decline in Apple's sales, as demand for its products in China falls. By contrast, Samsung sales were flat, and overall smartphone shipments grew 8%.⁠
⁠
🇨🇳 Samsung only has a small foothold in the Chinese market, while Apple was a major player in the region last year, boasting over 17% market share. And, like in so many other sectors, Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for a “Made in China” option, with Apple facing intense competition in the nation from rivals Transsion and Xiaomi, both of which reported strong double-digit growth in the most recent quarter. With fewer groundbreaking new features in recent releases, consumers are also holding onto their devices for longer.⁠
⁠
🍏 Apple has been working hard to diversify away from the iPhone, but the product remains the primary gateway into the Apple ecosystem and its infamous walled garden — and the slump in sales comes at a tough time. The recently launched Vision Pro headset is struggling to gain traction, and the company faces a DOJ lawsuit over the iPhone's alleged monopolistic power. All told, the company’s shares have lagged the wider market (S&P 500) by 13% this year.⁠ 100m iSHIPPED LESS Samsung Retakes The Smartphone Crown Smartphone Shipments for Samsung & Apple [Worldwide, millions of units] 80m SAMSUNG 60m 40m 20m Samsung sold 60m units to Apple's 50m in Q1 0m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2019 Q1 Q2 Q3 2020 CHARTR 2021 Q4 Q1 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 2Q3Q4Q10203Q401 Q3 Q4 Q1 2022 2023 24 Source: International Data Corporation"

GazeTrak, developed by Cornell’s SciFi Lab, is the first eye-tracking system that relies on acoustic signals, allowing more privacy for the user. The speakers and microphones mounted on the eyeglass frame bounce inaudible soundwaves off the face and pick up reflected signals caused by face and eye movements.

“There are many camera-based systems in this area of research or even on commercial products to track facial expressions or gaze movements, like Vision Pro or Oculus,” lead researcher Ke Li said. “But not everyone wants cameras on wearables to capture you and your surroundings all the time.” #CornellAI #Cornell"

What is XR Design? (Read the caption below )
XR is short for Extended Reality. It refers to the over lap of design and technology that alters reality by adding digital elements to the physical or real-world environment and includes but is not limited to Augmented Reality (AR) , Mixed Reality (MR), Virtual Reality (VR), Machine Learning , Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Sound Design to any extent that allows for better UX and UI experiences.

However, what stays consistent is my inclination to capture the essence and details of objects and places that I photograph. I am particularly fond of still life photography. One of my favorite activities is to set up different still life scenes and shoot them on film.”

⁠
Apple's Vision Pro headset was a bit of a sensation when it was released earlier this year, with YouTubers and influencers the world over fighting to get their hands on one.⁠
⁠
One YouTuber, though, has been hard at work with a truly impressive project, which he's now finished at last - a home-made Apple Vision Pro.⁠
⁠
Iconic YouTuber, Basically Homeless, has a history of trying to jerry-rig products together to see how close they can get, and this time it's truly a DIY attempt. It’s definitely a little more cumbersome than the Vision Pro but it’s a heck of a lot cheaper to make.⁠

Michael Koehler’s work may be best described as a conduit linking the natural and mechanical worlds, with humanity teetering somewhere between the two. “There’s harmony at play in my work but it’s precarious and oftentimes the pendulum swings one way or the other”. 

Working predominantly in acrylic, Koehler creates meticulously rendered portraits of surreal human and animal subjects using a vibrant color palette. The subjects are assembled from a tangled array of wires, tubes, plants, and flowers. Existing in an alternate reality where the natural and unnatural grow in tandem, the two coalesce into something altogether greater than the sum of their many parts.

He praised the dynamic range of its cameras, addressing concerns about surgical lighting overshadowing surrounding areas.

During the procedure at Hospital Jaraguá in Jaraguá do Sul, Dr. Gobbato utilized the Vision Pro to seamlessly view notes, patient x-rays, and live camera feeds simultaneously. This innovative approach enhances surgical precision, particularly during shoulder arthroscopy.

Dr. Gobbato emphasized the device's ability to display 3D models and real-time patient data, revolutionizing surgical visualization. The adaptive camera mitigates challenges posed by bright operating room lights, ensuring optimal visibility without compromising surrounding areas.

His pioneering use of the Apple Vision Pro sets a new standard in orthopedic surgery, marking a significant advancement in surgical technology. To see the device in action, watch the demonstration video.

marksmendaily,2024-04-23,5,https://www.instagram.com/p/C6GTNPxyH55/,"@apple, the tech giant known for its innovative products, has set its sights on the Indian market. With the success of its first two stores in Mumbai and New Delhi, Apple is now aggressively expanding its retail presence in India. The company's foray into the Indian market has proven to be a lucrative move, with each store generating revenues of Rs 190-210 crore in the last fiscal year. These figures place the Indian outlets among Apple's top-performing retail stores globally.
 
Since their inception, the two stores have consistently achieved impressive monthly average sales of Rs 16-17 crore each. The Mumbai store has had a slight edge over its Delhi counterpart, owing to its larger size. These numbers have far exceeded Apple's expectations and have matched the success of some of the company's best-performing store launches worldwide. Apple's retail stores in India have played a crucial role in driving the company's growth in the country. By providing a platform for customers to experience its products and services, Apple has been able to steadily increase its market share in India. The company aims to achieve a double-digit smartphone volume market share in India, surpassing its current 7% share by 2023.
 
Apple's expansion plans in India are part of its larger strategy to tap into the growing Indian market. The company has been doubling down on its efforts in India, especially in light of geopolitical tensions and a slump in sales in the US and China. Alongside expanding its retail presence, Apple has been ramping up local manufacturing operations to cater to domestic demand and exports. With plans for expansion into Pune, Bengaluru, and Noida, as well as the launch of the Apple Vision Pro headset, Apple is set to strengthen its position in the Indian market.

geonewsdottv,2024-04-24,503,https://www.instagram.com/p/C6JqS19MZ4Q/,"Apple is reportedly reducing its production of Vision Pro headsets as demand for them has decreased, The Verge reported.

Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo reported that Apple has reduced the production of its virtual reality (VR) headsets from 800,000 to only 400,000 even before their launch outside the United States.

The demand for the $3,500 VR headset has dropped much lower than they were expecting.

As per Kuo, Apple is expecting the demand to fall even lower in the next year, which is why the company is said to be ""reviewing and adjusting"" its headset product roadmap, possibly working on a much lower entry-level mixed reality headset.

He has also claimed that Apple plans to introduce the Vision Pro in new markets prior to the June Worldwide Developers Conference in an attempt to raise demand.

According to a February report by Kuo, Apple is working to improve the speed of production as well as supply change management. He reported that it does not plan on changing product specifications or the user experience.

Imagine in Spatial computing, like Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest 4, If I could make the viewer see the clothes I wanted them to see instead of what I was actually wearing, then this must be the first time since the emperor that this has happened.

⁠
Demand for the $3,500 VR headset has apparently not been what the tech giant had hoped for, as Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote earlier this week that Apple has slashed its sales expectations for the Vision Pro nearly in half. ⁠
⁠
Their shipment forecast for the year now sits at 400,000-450,000 units, a far cry from the initial market consensus of 700,000-800,000 units. ⁠
⁠
The slow down has reportedly caused Apple to review its VR ambitions, and we may not end up getting a 2nd generation Vision Pro next year as many previously thought. ⁠
⁠
It's not a surprise to see Vision Pro sales tailing off so quickly. It still lacks native apps for popular services like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify. And with its weight, some users have experienced pain after prolonged periods of use. ⁠

The comment appears to show his skepticism of the potential success of a product like Apple's Vision Pro.

""And I still think that that's gonna be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product,"" the CEO said. ""But now, it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display,"" Zuckerberg said.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify Zuckerberg's comments.

Meta launched its latest version of Ray-Ban smart glasses in September. The device has a starting price of $299 and includes access to Meta AI, a camera, the ability to make calls, and built-in speakers.

""Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear,"" the CEO said. ""So their full context on what's going on around you.""

The CEO said he thinks the glasses have ""the ability to be a pretty meaningful and growing platform sooner than then I would have expected so.""

While Meta's Quest virtual reality headset competes with Apple's Vision Pro, Zuckerberg has said before that he doesn't imagine a future of people walking around with virtual reality headsets.

""That's certainly not the future that I'm hoping we get to,"" Zuckerberg said to podcast host Andrew Huberman in an interview in October 2023.

It's not the first time the CEO has thrown shade at the Apple Vision Pro and tried to one-up Meta's competitor. In February,Zuckerberg posted a video of himself reviewing Apple's competing device and said the Quest didn't just have better value but that it was ""the better product period""

In the video, Zuckerberg also listed a number of features on Meta's Quest that he said were better than the Vision Pro, like a brighter screen and wider field of vision.

Zuckerberg isn't the one executive at the tech giant to drag the Apple Vision Pro. Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, previously said the product was very uncomfortable. BUSINESS INSIDER AFRICA MARKETS MARK ZUCKERBERG APPEARED TO TAKE A SHOT AT APPLE'S VISION PRO"

Menurut Kuo, Apple telah memangkas produksi unit Vision Pro yang aslinya akan berjumlah 800 ribu unit di tahun 2024.

Angka tersebut dipangkas menjadi sekitar 400 ribu sampai 450 ribu unit saja. Keputusan tersebut disebut diambil Apple tepat sebelum headset lintas realitas dimaksud rilis untuk pasar luar Amerika Serikat.

Hal ini ditandai dengan menurunnya minat pasar AS terhadap headset seharga $3500 ini menurut sumber lain. Performa yang buruk di pasar juga berarti Apple berkemungkinan untuk menunda perilisan unit upgrade di tahun 2025 nanti.

yesterday startup hub @lift99kyivhub held a hackathon in collaboration with the partners @tehnoyizhak and @readdle.team 

Readdle has been LIFT99s residents for over a year, and because they have access to invaluable knowledge - organizing this hackathon was a must. Dmitrii Golovanov, a project engineer at Readdle with 6+ years of experience in iOS development, and his team have adapted the Spark app for AVP and launched it before the glasses were released. Apple Vision Pro had approximately 200,000 preorders and had a minimum competition marketplace 😎

we wanted to SPARK (no pun inten.. it was intended) a conversation. Do you need to adapt your app to the new technology ASAP, will it help you boost your reach and is it really that hard or could it be done in 1 day?

we know the answer to the last one and it is a firm YES... if you know how to do it properly. read our blog where we gathered all the insights (in @lift99kyivhub bio)

In a groundbreaking development, surgeon Bruno Gobbato in Brazil has achieved success utilizing an Apple Vision Pro headset to enhance a surgical procedure.

Traditionally, shoulder arthroscopy surgery involves surgeons utilizing a camera within the joint while performing the procedure by viewing the images on a screen. However, with the integration of this innovative device, Gobbato was able to visualize the surgical field on a screen equivalent to the size of a movie screen, boasting high resolution. Additionally, the headset enabled him to observe the patient’s examinations and 3D models in real-time, providing a comprehensive and detailed perspective during the operation.

Anticipated by experts, the utilization of such technology is expected to become commonplace in Brazilian healthcare in the near future, revolutionizing surgical practices and enhancing patient outcomes.

He praised the dynamic range of its cameras, addressing concerns about surgical lighting overshadowing surrounding areas. 
 
During the procedure at Hospital Jaraguá in Jaraguá do Sul, Dr. Gobbato utilized the Vision Pro to seamlessly view notes, patient x-rays, and live camera feeds simultaneously. This innovative approach enhances surgical precision, particularly during shoulder arthroscopy. 
 
Dr. Gobbato emphasized the device's ability to display 3D models and real-time patient data, revolutionizing surgical visualization. The adaptive camera mitigates challenges posed by bright operating room lights, ensuring optimal visibility without compromising surrounding areas. 
 
His pioneering use of the Apple Vision Pro sets a new standard in orthopedic surgery, marking a significant advancement in surgical technology. To see the device in action, watch the demonstration video.

Surgeon, Bruno Gobbato:

""Shoulder arthroscopy surgery uses a camera inside the joint and surgeons perform it by looking directly at a screen. With this device, I was able to see the image on the size of a movie screen with high resolution, as well as being able to see the patient's exams and 3D models in real-time.""

Experts expect the device to be used routinely in Brazilian healthcare soon.
